                <p><em>Last updated: 09/12/18</em></p>
<p>Welcome to Textile. Please read these terms of service (these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) carefully as they form a contract between you and We Are Set, Inc, a Delaware corporation (<strong>Textile</strong>, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”), that governs your access and use of (i) the web verification and encryption solution software provided by Textile (the “<strong>Software</strong>”); (ii) the Textile websites at textile.io and textile.photos (the “<strong>Site</strong>”); and (iii) any written or electronic use or features guides or other documentation provided or made available by Textile (the “<strong>User Guides</strong>”) (collectively the “<strong>Service(s)</strong>”).</p>
<p><strong>By registering or using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.</strong> If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Textile that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization). You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Textile and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES</strong>. Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact <strong><a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#116;&#101;&#120;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#105;&#111;">&#112;&#114;&#105;&#118;&#97;&#99;&#121;&#64;&#116;&#101;&#120;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#105;&#111;</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that Textile does not provide warranties for the Services. This contract also limits our liability to you and contains an arbitration provision and a class action waiver. See Sections 14 (NO WARRANTY), 16 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) and 19 (ARBITRATION) of these Terms for details.</strong></p>
<h2 id="1-about-the-service">1. ABOUT THE SERVICE<a class="headerlink" href="#1-about-the-service" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The Service offers verification and authentication services and encryption services for users of photos and other personally collected data. The Service provides a private data storage system ("<strong>Storage</strong>") for users to maintain remote copies of their privately encrypted data. Storage is managed on IPFS (<a href="https://www.ipfs.io/">https://www.ipfs.io/</a>) nodes running on a user's personal device. The Service allows users to sync encrypted copies of their data privately with other devices. The service also allows users to create groups of multiple people who all use a shared encryption key to post, comment, and interact with encrypted photos and other data shared by group members ("<strong>Sharing</strong>" and "<strong>Threads</strong>"). Copies of data will be cached, on voluntary IPFS peers on the network including peers hosted by Textile, whenever a user shares data in a group Thread. Cached copies of shared data will be encrypted with keys only available to Thread members and so not readable by anyone else on the network.</p>
<h2 id="2-changes-to-these-terms">2. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS<a class="headerlink" href="#2-changes-to-these-terms" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time. We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Site. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms). If, in our sole discretion, we deem a revision to these Terms to be material, we will notify you via the Service and/or by email to the email address associated with your account. Notice of other changes may be provided via the Site. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of these Terms whenever you visit the Site to see if these Terms have been updated. Your continued access or use of any portion of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such changes. If you don’t agree to any of the changes, we’re not obligated to keep providing the Service to you, and you must cancel and stop using the Service.</p>
<h2 id="3-access-to-the-service">3. ACCESS TO THE SERVICE<a class="headerlink" href="#3-access-to-the-service" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>

<h2 id="17-arbitration-class-action-waiver">17. ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER<a class="headerlink" href="#17-arbitration-class-action-waiver" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<h3 id="171">17.1<a class="headerlink" href="#171" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Introduction. This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.</p>
<h3 id="172">17.2<a class="headerlink" href="#172" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.</p>
<h3 id="173-arbitration-agreement">17.3 Arbitration Agreement<a class="headerlink" href="#173-arbitration-agreement" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, “Claim”) relating in any way to your use of Textile’s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below.</p>
<p>Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p>If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18<sup>th</sup> Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>
<p>The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</p>
<p>Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>
<p>The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below.</p>
<p>If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#108;&#101;&#103;&#97;&#108;&#64;&#116;&#101;&#120;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#105;&#111;">&#108;&#101;&#103;&#97;&#108;&#64;&#116;&#101;&#120;&#116;&#105;&#108;&#101;&#46;&#105;&#111;</a>] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>CLASS ACTION WAIVER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California.</p>
