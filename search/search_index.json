This is a great place to start if you're a developer interested in using Textile's decentralized tooling in your mobile, desktop, or web applications. Introduction \u00b6 Textile is a set of tools to help you and your team build decentralized apps, fast. Textile is primarily built on IPFS and makes it easy for you or your application to store and distribute data over the IPFS network. Some features of Textile you may find useful include: Push files, directories, and websites to the IPFS network. Textile's Buckets are an intuitive way for you to host and manage data on IPFS. Buckets run on IPFS and Threads, but you don't have to remember content addresses to use them! Collaboratively update and manage Buckets with your team through simple collaborative projects and access control. Your organization can quickly host app assets or entire webpages on IPFS. Integration with CI tools makes this a breeze. Add decentralized databases to your web, mobile, or desktop application. Create databases on IPFS that are private for one user or shared with many. The Threads DB is an advanced decentralized database and networking protocol for IPFS. Other things about Textile and Threads you may like include their open source, MIT licenses, active developer support on our public Slack group , and a deep technical paper to get your neurons firing. Getting Started \u00b6 Textile is a command-line interface that gives you access to everything listed above and more. To get started, here's what you need to do Info Download Textile to your computer. You can find the latest release for on our GitHub releases page . Textile is built for all the common architectures used in Mac (Darwin), Windows, and Linux. If your architecture isn't listed, ping us on Slack and we can give you instructions to build a version ready for your system. Run Textile for the first time, the help command is a useful place to start. textile --help The Textile client. Usage: textile [ command ] Available Commands: buckets Manage project buckets help Help about any command init Init a new project login Login logout Logout projects Manage projects switch Switch teams or personal account teams Team management whoami Show user or team Teams and Projects \u00b6 To start using remote services such as IPFS pinning, Bucket sharing, and Thread APIs, you'll need an account on Textile. Textile provides a simple, password-less account setup. You can create a new account by logging in with your valid email address for the first time. Login \u00b6 textile login Enter your email: you@domain.app\u2588 > We sent an email to you@domain.app. Please follow the steps provided inside it. Go to your inbox and look for the verification email and follow the instructions inside. After complete, your terminal should output a confirmation: \u2714 Email confirmed > Success! You are now logged in. Initialize a new project directory with ` textile init ` . That's it, you can now start using Textile, IPFS, and Threads. Create a Team \u00b6 By default, you'll be on your own in Textile, you'll probably want to create (or join) a team before you start building. textile teams add <new team name> Switch to Team \u00b6 To use your new team, you need to use the switch command to select your newly created team. textile switch Use the arrow keys to navigate: \u2193 \u2191 \u2192 \u2190 ? Switch to: \u25b8 you@domain.app ( current ) <new team name> Invite another member to your team \u00b6 textile teams invite Enter email to invite: other@domain.app\u2588 > Success! We sent other@domain.app an invitation to the new team. Join a team \u00b6 If someone else has already created a team for you to join, you'll receive an invite email. Simply follow the instructions in the email to join and use the new team. List your teams \u00b6 textile teams ls NAME ID <new team name> f62cdc2b-9404-40ed-8467-ea804fcc35f1 > Found 2 teams Create a Project \u00b6 Teams on Textile may create different Projects. Projects are useful to organize resources or user groups in your app. Creating a new one is simple. First, navigate to the directory where you'd like to build your project, mkdir txtl-project cd txtl-project/ Next, tell Textile to create a project in this directory. Similar to Git, Textile will create a simple config file in this directly under, .textile/config.yaml . textile projects init my-new-project > Success! Initialized empty project in /Users/me/txtl-project/.textile Because you are have switched to your team, this project should now be available to other members of your team also. Host data in Buckets \u00b6 Textile includes a textile buckets tool that makes it simple for you to pin files to IFPS. The files you pin can be used as part or all of the interface to your dApp. You can think of buckets much like you might already think of buckets on S3 (or if you aren't familiar, just think of them as folders). As an extra bonus, if any bucket you create contains an index.html file, Textile will host the bucket as a web site at https://<bucket-name>.textile.cafe . Read on to see an example. Push files \u00b6 To start pinning files in your Textile project, use the push sub command. You can push a single file to a bucket or an entire directory, in which case all contained files and directories are pushed recursively. All paths will be created if they don't exist and you can use push repeatedly to keep adding more files to a bucket. Here, we push files for a static web site to a bucket called aaron : textile buckets push public/* aaron Add 44 files? Press ENTER to confirm: \u2588 > Pushing mySite/public/404/index.html to aaron/404/index.html 9 .87 kB / 9 .87 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 78 .69 kB p/s 0s > Pushing mySite/public/404.html to aaron/404.html 9 .88 kB / 9 .88 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 260 .14 kB p/s 1s > Pushing mySite/public/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js to aaron/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js 98 .14 kB / 98 .14 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 307 .59 kB p/s 0s > Pushing mySite/public/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js.map to aaron/app-b1262bbd5ce4afcb17ea.js.map 390 .09 kB / 390 .09 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 376 .47 kB p/s 1s > Pushing mySite/public/chunk-map.json to aaron/chunk-map.json ... > Success!

You can pull an entire bucket, a sub tree of a bucket, or a single file. textile buckets pull aaron/icons/icon-512x512.png ./ > Pulling aaron/icons/icon-512x512.png to icon-512x512.png 22 .45 kB / 22 .45 kB [ -------------------------------- ] 100 .00% 818 .35 kB p/s 0s > Success! Pulled 1 files to ./ Removing files \u00b6 The buckets rm command is used to remove files or directories from a bucket. Once a bucket is empty, the root bucket directory is deleted and will no longer appear in the list of buckets output from textile buckets ls . textile buckets rm aaron/aaron.txt > Success! Removed aaron/aaron.txt Accessing on cloud.textile.io \u00b6 You can access the latest version of the files in your bucket (without needing to know any CID!) at https://cloud.textile.io/dashboard/<project name>/<bucket name> . Of course since the data is all stored in IPFS, it's also available over https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/<CID> . The CID for any Textile bucket or bucket sub directory is listed at the top of the corresponding cloud.textile.io/dahsboard page and in the output from textile buckets ls . Hosting web sites in Buckets \u00b6 Any bucket that contains an index.html file will be hosted as a web site at https://<bucket-name>.textile.cafe . In the textile buckets push example above, we pushed files that make up a static web site to a bucket named aaron . That web site is automatically available (with TLS!) at https://aaron.textile.cafe . Read more about hosting websites in Buckets here . Updating Buckets with CI \u00b6 Buckets can be managed as part of your CI workflows. Read more about updating your Buckets in CI here . A Decentralized Database \u00b6 A scalable, secure, multi-user, database for developers Want simple Filebase or MongoDB type functionality in your app? Textile provides Threads - A decentralized database built on IPFS. Threads give your app a way to store private data for one user or synchronize data across many peers. For a deep dive over breakfast, read the Threads Whitepaper . For now, here's a quick tour. The Threads Whitepaper outlines a number of new innovations, some highlights include: Standardized key management for securing data created in your apps An easy interface to create and update models (think MongoDB) A simple way for data owners to invite new members to their database Technically, Each thread contains a store (where data is kept) and models (the data structures you store and update). Threads are collaborative, for one to many users. By default, each thread your app creates for a user is private (fully encrypted) but can then be shared with other users who can then have access to just read or read & write to the same Thread. Data is transferred over IPFS, but it is encrypted by keys only available to people invited to the thread. If you would like to start testing Threads v2 you can use any of the following libraries. Name Status Platforms Description Implementations go-threads Threads reference implementation. js-threads Work in Progress. JavaScript implementation. Clients js-threads-client A JavaScript client for the threads daemon. dart-threads-client A Dart client for the threads daemon. Examples go-foldersync An e2e demo to sync data between two golang clients. js-foldersync A demo of writing and reading models with the js-threads-client. Planned andoroid-threads-client An Android client for the threads daemon. ios-threads-client An iOS client for the threads daemon. Hosted Threads \u00b6 The easiest way to get started with Threads is through Textile's hosted service. In this case, Threads can leverage your team's Textile resources (buckets, pinning, and networking). First, you'll need to create a Textile app token using the textile CLI. Create an app token \u00b6 App tokens allow you to access Textile resources from within apps you build. You can create new app tokens in your project in just a few seconds. textile project tokens add > Selected ethden > Success! Added new token <your new token> Use the token in your app \u00b6 To use your token with your app, simply follow the instructions available in either of the Textile client libraries here (support for other languages and platfirms coming soon!): js-textile : a library to authenticate your textile app token and use dart-textile : a library to authenticate your textile app token and use dart-threads-client in your app. Voila, now you have an app running a Threads database over IPFS with Textile ensuring that database content is pinned to the network no matter when or if your users remain online. App example \u00b6 The best way to learn how to use Threads is by checkout out our todo list and folder sync example apps. Local debugging \u00b6 The preceding instructions have you set up to use Textile's hosted Threads server. Sometimes when developing with Threads, it can be helpful to use a local Threads server called threadsd instead. You can connect an app using any of the Threads client libraries to the local threadsd , and then use the threads shell to view models, data, and watch events as they change data in real-time. Install the daemon and shell \u00b6 Visit the threads releases page. https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/releases Download the latest release for your platform, Linux, Windows, or Mac (darwin). Install threadsd and threads (or the .exe s on Windows) application. Run the threadsd application without any parameters. tar -xzvf go-threads_v0.1.9_darwin-amd64.tar.gz x install-threads/ x install-threads/install x install-threads/threadsd x install-threads/LICENSE x install-threads/README.md x install-threads/threads cd install-threads/ ./install Moved ./threads to /usr/local/bin Moved ./threadsd to /usr/local/bin threadsd Welcome to Threads! Your peer ID is 12D3KooWFFCiJt6B8Dog9ECpt7KGfqxjUxNktzpTK4e4mzQ51WPG Note for MacOS: By default, MacOS will prevent threadsd from running. After trying and failing once, you'll have to visit System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, choose to allow threadsd to run, and then run threadsd again. Update your project to use local daemon \u00b6 Updating your project to use the locally running threadsd is as simple as setting the dev flag in the Textile.API constructor. Here's an example in Javascript: import { API } from '@textile/textile' import { Client } from '@textile/threads-client' const api = new API ({ token : \"<textile project token>\" , deviceId : \"<user id>\" , dev : true // causes the below client to use the local threadsd }) await api . start () const threadsClient = new Client ( api . threadsConfig ) Use threads shell to monitor data updates \u00b6 Start up the threads shell which will connect to your local threadsd : threads Successfully connected. >>> You first need to specify a store id to operate on using the use command: >>> use <store id> Switched to <store id> >>> Note: You can find your store id by logging it or setting a breakpoint in your app when you create a Theads store. Another note: In reality, you'll want to keep track of store ids you app creates so you can access those stores at a later time. View all updates to the data in the current store using the listen command: >>> listen <enter> to cancel { \"ID\" : \"5389d030-22b4-4327-aed5-10ae1f1f14d8\" , \"files\" : [] , \"owner\" : \"myFolder\" } { \"ID\" : \"5389d030-22b4-4327-aed5-10ae1f1f14d8\" , \"files\" : [ { \"ID\" : \"25ea5bc5-cbef-4619-9380-9725388f873b\" , \"cid\" : \"\" , \"files\" : [] , \"isDirectory\" : false, \"name\" : \"filecoin.pdf\" } ] , \"owner\" : \"myFolder\" } Explore data using the modelFind and modelFindById commands. Filecoin \u00b6 We recently announced our initiative to build developer tools for Filecoin. Those tools will leverage and link into Threads v2 and the Textile CLI to give developers simple ways to leverage Filecoin. You can follow our Filecoin progress here .","title":"A Tour of Textile"},{"location":"a-tour-of-textile/#introduction","text":"Textile is a set of tools to help you and your team build decentralized apps, fast.

Libraries are under active development, and this material may not reflect the latest changes. Please view the primary code-repositories and look out for our release announcements soon. Want simple Filebase or MongoDB type functionality in your app? Textile provides Threads - A decentralized database built on IPFS. Threads give your app a way to store private data for one user or synchronize data across many peers. For a deep dive over breakfast, read the Threads Whitepaper . For now, here's a quick tour. The Threads Whitepaper outlines a number of new innovations, some highlights include: Standardized key management for securing data created in your apps An easy interface to create and update models (think MongoDB) A simple way for data owners to invite new members to their database Technically, Each thread contains a store (where data is kept) and models (the data structures you store and update). Threads are collaborative, for one to many users. By default, each thread your app creates for a user is private (fully encrypted) but can then be shared with other users who can then have access to just read or read & write to the same Thread. Data is transferred over IPFS, but it is encrypted by keys only available to people invited to the thread. If you would like to start testing Threads v2 you can use any of the following libraries. Name Status Platforms Description Implementations go-threads Threads reference implementation. js-threads Work in Progress. JavaScript implementation. Clients js-threads-client A JavaScript client for the threads daemon. dart-threads-client A Dart client for the threads daemon. Examples go-foldersync An e2e demo to sync data between two golang clients. js-foldersync A demo of writing and reading models with the js-threads-client. Planned andoroid-threads-client An Android client for the threads daemon. ios-threads-client An iOS client for the threads daemon. Hosted Threads \u00b6 The easiest way to get started with Threads is through Textile's hosted service. In this case, Threads can leverage your team's Textile resources (buckets, pinning, and networking). First, you'll need to create a Textile app token using the textile CLI. Create an app token \u00b6 App tokens allow you to access Textile resources from within apps you build. You can create new app tokens in your project in just a few seconds. textile project tokens add > Selected ethden > Success! Added new token <your new token> Use the token in your app \u00b6 To use your token with your app, simply follow the instructions available in either of the Textile client libraries here (support for other languages and platfirms coming soon!): js-textile : a library to authenticate your textile app token and use dart-textile : a library to authenticate your textile app token and use dart-threads-client in your app. Voila, now you have an app running a Threads database over IPFS with Textile ensuring that database content is pinned to the network no matter when or if your users remain online. App example \u00b6 The best way to learn how to use Threads is by checkout out our todo list and folder sync example apps. Local debugging \u00b6 The preceding instructions have you set up to use Textile's hosted Threads server. Sometimes when developing with Threads, it can be helpful to use a local Threads server called threadsd instead. You can connect an app using any of the Threads client libraries to the local threadsd , and then use the threads shell to view models, data, and watch events as they change data in real-time. Install the daemon and shell \u00b6 Visit the threads releases page. https://github.com/textileio/go-threads/releases Download the latest release for your platform, Linux, Windows, or Mac (darwin).

Want simple Filebase or MongoDB type functionality in your app? Textile provides Threads - A decentralized database built on IPFS. Threads give your app a way to store private data for one user or synchronize data across many peers. For a deep dive over breakfast, read the Threads Whitepaper . For now, here's a quick tour. The Threads Whitepaper outlines a number of new innovations, some highlights include: Standardized key management for securing data created in your apps An easy interface to create and update models (think MongoDB) A simple way for data owners to invite new members to their database Technically, Each thread contains a store (where data is kept) and models (the data structures you store and update). Threads are collaborative, for one to many users. By default, each thread your app creates for a user is private (fully encrypted) but can then be shared with other users who can then have access to just read or read & write to the same Thread. Data is transferred over IPFS, but it is encrypted by keys only available to people invited to the thread. If you would like to start testing Threads v2 you can use any of the following libraries.

Please read these terms of service (these \u201c Terms \u201d) carefully as they form a contract between you and We Are Set, Inc, a Delaware corporation ( Textile , \u201c we \u201d, \u201c us \u201d, or \u201c our \u201d), that governs your access and use of (i) the web verification and encryption solution software provided by Textile (the \u201c Software \u201d); (ii) the Textile websites at textile.io and textile.photos (the \u201c Site \u201d); and (iii) any written or electronic use or features guides or other documentation provided or made available by Textile (the \u201c User Guides \u201d) (collectively the \u201c Service(s) \u201d). By registering or using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Textile that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer to that organization). You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Textile and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES . Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact privacy@textile.io . Please note that Textile does not provide warranties for the Services. This contract also limits our liability to you and contains an arbitration provision and a class action waiver. See Sections 14 (NO WARRANTY), 16 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) and 19 (ARBITRATION) of these Terms for details. 1. ABOUT THE SERVICE \u00b6 The Service offers verification and authentication services and encryption services for users of photos and other personally collected data. The Service provides a private data storage system (\" Storage \") for users to maintain remote copies of their privately encrypted data. Storage is managed on IPFS ( https://www.ipfs.io/ ) nodes running on a user's personal device. The Service allows users to sync encrypted copies of their data privately with other devices. The service also allows users to create groups of multiple people who all use a shared encryption key to post, comment, and interact with encrypted photos and other data shared by group members (\" Sharing \" and \" Threads \"). Copies of data will be cached, on voluntary IPFS peers on the network including peers hosted by Textile, whenever a user shares data in a group Thread. Cached copies of shared data will be encrypted with keys only available to Thread members and so not readable by anyone else on the network. 2. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS \u00b6 We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time. We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Site. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms).

ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER \u00b6 17.1 \u00b6 Introduction. This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. 17.2 \u00b6 Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. 17.3 Arbitration Agreement \u00b6 After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California. 18. NOTICES \u00b6 We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide.

It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors. 19.4. \u00b6 Claims You must bring any claim related to these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims. If it isn\u2019t filed in time, the claim is permanently barred. 19.5. \u00b6 Waiver The failure of you or Textile to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of your right or Textile\u2019s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect. 19.6. \u00b6 Government Use If you are a U.S. government entity, you acknowledge that any Software and User Guides that are provided are \u201cCommercial Items\u201d as defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, and are being provided as commercial computer software subject to the restricted rights described in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212. 20.

This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.","title":"17.1"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#172","text":"Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.","title":"17.2"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#173-arbitration-agreement","text":"After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California.","title":"17.3 Arbitration Agreement"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#18-notices","text":"We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide.
