This is a great place to start if you're a developer interested in using Textile's decentralized tooling in your mobile, desktop, or web applications. However, anyone interested in learning how to run and interact with a Textile peer will also find this tour useful. Concepts \u00b6 The rest of this document assumes that you are somewhat familiar with the following concepts: Introduction The wallet and accounts Contacts and peers Threads and blocks Files , schemas , and mills Cafes Get started \u00b6 If you're using the command-line or JavaScript HTTP client, make sure your local daemon is running. Info Peer-to-peer (p2p) slang is notoriously confusing. Throughout these docs, we often use the words \"peer\" and \"node\". Generally speaking, they are interchangeable. However, a network node refers to the actual connection point that sends and receives data. On a p2p network like IPFS, all nodes are also peers . The network is like a \"homogeneous solution\" of particles (nodes). Mother Nature gets it! Connecting your client \u00b6 If you are running any of the client libraries (JavaScript, React Native, iOS, or Android), you will need to import and sometimes initialize your Textile session. Initialization is slightly different in each client so be sure to read specific client setup steps for the library you use. JavaScript // No initialization needed, only import import textile from \"@textile/js-http-client\" React Native import textile from \"@textile/react-native-sdk\" // Make the sensitive below phrase available to your user for secure storage const phrase : string | undefined = await textile . initialize ( false , false ) Objective-C // Early on in the app lifecycle, usually in AppDelegate // Initialize a new Textile wallet for the user. NSError * error ; NSString * recoveryPhrase = [ Textile initializeWithDebug : FALSE logToDisk : FALSE error : & error ]; if ( recoveryPhrase ) { // Return phrase to the user for secure, out of app, storage } if ( error ) { NSLog ( @\"initialize error: %@\" , error . localizedDescription ); } // Set the Textile delegate to any object that conforms to the TextileDelegate protocol Textile . instance . delegate = delegate ; Swift do { // recoveryPhrase should be optional here, fix coming asap let recoveryPhrase = try Textile . initialize ( withDebug : false , logToDisk : false ) // Return phrase to the user for secure, out of app, storage // Set the Textile delegate to self so we can make use of events such nodeStarted Textile . instance (). delegate = self } catch { print ( \"Unexpected error: \\( error ) .\" ) } Android String recoveryPhrase = Textile . initialize ( this . getApplicationContext (), false , false ); if ( recoveryPhrase != nil ) { // Return phrase to the user for secure, out of app, storage } class MyEventListener extends BaseTextileEventListener { // ... } Textile . instance (). addEventListener ( new MyEventListener ()); Peer profile \u00b6 Now, with Textile ready, take a look at your peer profile: cmd textile profile get JavaScript const profile = await textile . profile . get () React Native const profile = await textile . profile . get () Objective-C NSError * error ; Peer * profile = [ Textile . instance . profile get : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let profile = Textile . instance (). profile . get (& error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Peer profile = Textile . instance (). profile . get (); Success { \"id\" : \"12D3KooWCMVLfMV8uzYpFN38qn2eMs48tAuHdVZdj3aF6nex6zay\" , \"address\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"created\" : \"2019-04-19T21:44:46.310082Z\" , \"updated\" : \"2019-04-19T21:44:46.310082Z\" } id : Your embedded IPFS node's peer ID, which is unique on the network address : Your wallet account's address (public key), which can be shared with other account peers Hint Addresses always start with a \"P\" for \"public\". Account seeds (private keys) always start with an \"S\" for \"secret\", which should help you remember which one to keep secret. Info Textile uses an ed25519 HD wallet and IPFS peer IDs because they provide fast key generation, signing, and verification. These properties become important on less powerful devices like phones. Tip If you got a connection refused error, be sure that your textile daemon is running. Set a display name \u00b6 You can set a display name for your peer. Interacting with other users is a lot easier with display names. However, they are not unique on the network. cmd textile profile set --name=\"Clyde\" JavaScript await textile . profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" ) React Native await textile . profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" ) Objective-C NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . profile setName : @\"Clyde\" error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? Textile . instance (). profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Textile . instance (). profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" ); Success ok Set an avatar image \u00b6 Similarly, you can assign your peer a publicly visible avatar image: cmd textile profile set --avatar=\"path/to/an/image\" JavaScript const form = new FormData () form . append ( 'file' , file , file . name ) // file is File object or raw Buffer/Blob await textile . profile . setAvatar ( form ) React Native @ todo Objective-C @ todo Swift @ todo Android @todo Success ok Now, your avatar will be tracked internally by the special private account thread , keyed with your account seed. This means that when your avatar (or display name) is updated, your other account peers (if you have any) will also pick up the change. Take another look at your peer profile and see what happened: cmd textile profile get JavaScript const profile = await textile . profile . get () React Native const profile = await textile . profile . get () Objective-C NSError * error ; Peer * profile = [ Textile . instance . profile get : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let profile = Textile . instance (). profile . get (& error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Peer profile = Textile . instance (). profile . get (); Success { \"id\" : \"12D3KooWCMVLfMV8uzYpFN38qn2eMs48tAuHdVZdj3aF6nex6zay\" , \"address\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"name\" : \"Clyde\" , \"avatar\" : \"Qmea7R7cCSSkRZ5Jammj8xvkE44YvjDWz3aBuWm4PNcyf5\" , \"created\" : \"2019-04-19T21:44:46.310082Z\" , \"updated\" : \"2019-04-20T00:31:34.699845Z\" } Huzzah! If we had any threads, these updates would have been announced to them so that other members could pick up the changes. Account \u00b6 Generally speaking, you can think of peers as ephemeral agents owned by your account. You may lose your device and/or need to access your account on a new one. As mentioned above, all peers have a special private account thread . In addition to avatars, this thread keeps track of your account peers. View account \u00b6 Take a look at your account: cmd textile account get JavaScript const account = await textile . account . get () React Native // React native has endpoints for each component of the account const address = await textile . account . address () Objective-C NSString * address = [ Textile . instance . account address ]; Swift let adress = Textile . instance (). account . address () Android String address = Textile . instance (). account . address (); Success { \"address\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"name\" : \"Clyde\" , \"avatar\" : \"Qmea7R7cCSSkRZ5Jammj8xvkE44YvjDWz3aBuWm4PNcyf5\" , \"peers\" : [ { \"id\" : \"12D3KooWCMVLfMV8uzYpFN38qn2eMs48tAuHdVZdj3aF6nex6zay\" , \"address\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"name\" : \"Clyde\" , \"avatar\" : \"Qmea7R7cCSSkRZ5Jammj8xvkE44YvjDWz3aBuWm4PNcyf5\" , \"created\" : \"2019-04-19T21:44:46.310082Z\" , \"updated\" : \"2019-04-20T00:31:34.699845Z\" } ] } Yep, just one peer so far. This object is actually a contact . We'll come back to contacts later. View account seed \u00b6 Of course, your account seed (private key) is not included in the public-facing contact object, but we can access it with the seed command: cmd textile account seed JavaScript const seed = await textile . account . seed () React Native const seed = await textile . account . seed () Objective-C NSString * seed = [ Textile . instance . account seed ]; Swift let seed = Textile . instance (). account . seed () Android String seed = Textile . instance (). account . seed (); Success SXdGtLsxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Account sync \u00b6 Periodically, your local peer will search the network for other peers that are part of the same account ( account peers ). Technically, your local peer will search for thread snapshots created by any peer with your account address. If it finds any, the snapshots are decrypted and traversed like normal thread updates, keeping all your peers in sync. Hint A thread snapshot is an encrypted object containing metadata and a reference to the latest update block, from which all others can be found. A snapshot may be stored at rest on a cafe peer or constructed dynamically for an account peer. You can also manually run account sync: cmd textile account sync JavaScript await textile . account . sync () React Native await textile . account . sync () Objective-C NSError * error ; QueryOptions * options = [[ QueryOptions alloc ] init ]; [ Textile . instance . account sync : options error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let options = QueryOptions () Textile . instance (). account . sync ( options , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android QueryOptions options = QueryOptions . newBuilder (). build (); Textile . instance (). account . sync ( options ); Success No snapshots were found Well, that's what we'd expect at this point. You don't have any threads yet. We'll come back to this later in the tour. Contacts \u00b6 As we saw above in the accounts section, your peer has a contact for itself , much like iOS or other contact systems. A contact displays the name and avatar from its most recently updated peer. A contact is essentially a collection of peers that share the same account. Search for contacts \u00b6 In addition to your \"self\" contact, you can search for and add contacts to your local \"address book\". Info Search is handled by a publish-subscribe mechanism, where participants across the entire network stream results directly to the requester. In many cases, the search responders are cafe peers, serving indexes for their clients, but normal account peers can also participate in search. Try searching for \"Andrew\": cmd textile contacts search --name=\"Andrew\" JavaScript // The js-http-client returns a `ReadableStream` to be accessed by the caller // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream for details const stream = await textile . contacts . search ( \"Andrew\" ) React Native @ todo Objective-C NSError * error ; QueryOptions * options = [[ QueryOptions alloc ] init ]; options . wait = 10 ; options . limit = 1 ; ContactQuery * query = [[ ContactQuery alloc ] init ]; query . name = @\"Andrew\" ; MobileSearchHandle * handle = [ Textile . instance . contacts search : query options : options error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let options = QueryOptions () options . wait = 10 options . limit = 1 let query = ContactQuery () query . name = \"Andrew\" let handle = Textile . instance (). contacts . search ( query , options : options , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android QueryOptions options = QueryOptions . newBuilder () . setWait ( 10 ) . setLimit ( 1 ) . build (); ContactQuery query = ContactQuery . newBuilder () . setName ( \"Andrew\" ) . build (); SearchHandle handle = Textile . instance (). contacts . search ( query , options ); Success { \"id\" : \"P8FxdgZ1rWxaQ4DrmMBADuYTz4XGpQeThJYxfL2X4WN89hP8\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-12T21:41:28.071460350Z\" , \"value\" : { \"@type\" : \"/Contact\" , \"address\" : \"P8FxdgZ1rWxaQ4DrmMBADuYTz4XGpQeThJYxfL2X4WN89hP8\" , \"name\" : \"devandrewwww\" , \"avatar\" : \"QmQwmPninpCRdkAhbPwKaf7hAUwkTb2wiwupcgnsMp5yW5\" , \"peers\" : [ /* ... */ ] } } { \"id\" : \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , \"date\" : \"2019-02-08T02:59:35.082729740Z\" , \"value\" : { \"@type\" : \"/Contact\" , \"address\" : \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , \"name\" : \"andrew knees and toes, knees and toes\" , \"avatar\" : \"QmRLnTHdvg4rAh1AKJaHydAZ42sgygLNdvvA7aMwaRY5SK\" , \"peers\" : [ /* ... */ ] } } /* ... */ With any luck, you should see a bunch of results. You can also search for a single account by its address: cmd textile contacts search --address=\"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" JavaScript // Again, `stream` is a `ReadableStream` to be accessed by the caller const stream = await textile . contacts . search ( undefined , \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" ) React Native @ todo Objective-C NSError * error ; QueryOptions * options = [[ QueryOptions alloc ] init ]; options . wait = 10 ; options . limit = 1 ; ContactQuery * query = [[ ContactQuery alloc ] init ]; query . address = @\"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" ; MobileSearchHandle * handle = [ Textile . instance . contacts search : query options : options error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let options = QueryOptions () options . wait = 10 options . limit = 1 let query = ContactQuery () query . address = \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" let handle = Textile . instance (). contacts . search ( query , options : options , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android QueryOptions options = QueryOptions . newBuilder () . setWait ( 10 ) . setLimit ( 1 ) . build (); ContactQuery query = ContactQuery . newBuilder () . setAddress ( \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" ) . build (); SearchHandle handle = Textile . instance (). contacts . search ( query , options ); Success { \"id\" : \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , \"date\" : \"2019-02-08T02:59:35.082729740Z\" , \"value\" : { \"@type\" : \"/Contact\" , \"address\" : \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , \"name\" : \"andrew knees and toes, knees and toes\" , \"avatar\" : \"QmRLnTHdvg4rAh1AKJaHydAZ42sgygLNdvvA7aMwaRY5SK\" , \"peers\" : [ /* ... */ ] } } Add a contact \u00b6 We can add contacts by name or address. This will actually perform a search as above, and then present you with a prompt to confirm the addition. When you search by name, there may be more than one result. Try adding one of the contacts from above by address: cmd textile contacts add --address=\"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" JavaScript const contact = ... // Should be a Contact object, as returned by `search` `ReadableStream` await textile . contacts . add ( \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , contact ) React Native @ todo Objective-C Contact * searchResult = // Should be a Contact object as returned by contact search NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . contacts add : searchResult error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift let contact = // Should be a Contact object as returned by contact search var error : NSError ?

If you want to ping a mobile or desktop peer (a peer without a public IP address), you may need to connect to it first with textile ipfs connect /p2p-circuit/ipfs/<peerID> . See this section for more info about the IPFS sub-commands. Let's ping one of Textile's federated cafes: cmd textile ping 12D3KooWLh9Gd4C3knv4XqCyCuaNddfEoSLXgekVJzRyC5vsjv5d JavaScript await textile . utils . ping ( \"12D3KooWLh9Gd4C3knv4XqCyCuaNddfEoSLXgekVJzRyC5vsjv5d\" ) React Native @ todo Objective-C @ todo Swift @ todo Android @todo Success online Looking good. Threads \u00b6 Threads are distributed datasets of encrypted messages and files, often shared between peers, and governed by schemas. The rules for thread access and sharing are controlled by a combination of the type and sharing settings. An immutable member address \"whitelist\" gives the initiator fine-grained control. The table below outlines access patterns for the thread initiator and the whitelist members. An empty whitelist is taken to be \"everyone\", which is the default. Thread type controls read (R), annotate (A), and write (W) access: private --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: read_only --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: R public --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: RA open --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: RAW Thread sharing style controls if (Y/N) a thread can be shared: not_shared --> initiator: N, whitelist: N invite_only --> initiator: Y, whitelist: N shared --> initiator: Y, whitelist: Y` Check out the comprehensive threads overview for more about how threads work. Info Access control will be moving to a more familiar, roll-based design in a future release. See this GitHub issue for more. Create a basic thread \u00b6 Create a thread and give it the name, \"Basic\".

The most basic schema is the built-in passthrough, or blob schema: { \"name\" : \"blob\" , \"pin\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/blob\" } If you read the overview doc , you'll remember that thread schemas are DAG schemas that contain steps to create each node. \"blob\" defines a single top-level DAG node without any links. We'll get to more complex schemas later. pin instructs the peer to locally pin the entire DAG node when it's created from the input. mill defines the function used to process (or \"mill\") the data on arrival. /blob is a passthrough, meaning that the data comes out untouched. We can create a thread with this schema using the --blob flag: cmd textile threads add \"Any old data\" --key=\"your.bundle.id.version.Blob\" --blob JavaScript const thread = await textile . threads . add ( \"Any old data\" , \"blob\" ) React Native const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.Blob' const threadName = 'Any old data' const schema = { id : '' , json : '' , preset : AddThreadConfig .

Hint Any data added to a thread ends up as a file , regardless of whether or not the source data was an actual file. For example, echoing a string into a thread results in a \"file\" containing that string. Let's add some data. Be sure to use your own thread ID. cmd echo \"mmm, bytes...\" | textile files add <thread-id> JavaScript const block = await textile . files . add ( \"mmm, bytes...\" , \"\" , \"<thread-id>\" ) React Native const input = Buffer . from ( \"mmm, bytes...\" ). toString ( 'base64' ) const result = await textile . files . prepare ( input , \"<thread-id>\" ) const block = await textile . files . add ( result . dir , \"<thread-id>\" ) Objective-C NSString * threadId = @\"<thread-id>\" ; NSString * filePath = @\"/path/to/mmm-bytes....\" ; [ Textile . instance . files prepareByPath : filePath threadId : threadId completion : ^ ( MobilePreparedFiles * preparedFiles , NSError * error ) { if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { NSError * addFilesError ; [ Textile . instance . files add : preparedFiles . dir threadId : threadId caption : nil error : & addFilesError ]; if ( addFilesError ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } } }]; Swift let threadId = \"<thread-id>\" let filePath = \"/path/to/mmm-bytes....\" Textile . instance (). files . prepare ( byPath : filePath , threadId : threadId ) { ( preparedFiles , error ) in if let files = preparedFiles { var addFilesError : NSError ?

The peer created a new DAG node (a textile block) for the input as defined by the schema. Every schema step adds a child node with two links: The target shown in the output is the root hash of the DAG. meta : A JSON object containing metadata about the input and how it was processed. Which is the success output of the previosu command. content : The content of the file that was added, in the above command output, this is at .files[0].hash , and can be fetched via textile file get <hash> --content , or via textile file block get <block-id> --content . The files guide covers these concepts in more detail. Unless a schema step specifies \"plaintext\": true , the value of meta and content are both encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using their very own symmetric key. We can view the keys for each node in the DAG using the keys command: cmd textile files keys \"<block-target>\" JavaScript const keys = await textile . files . keys ( \"<block-target>\" ) React Native @ todo Objective-C @ todo Swift @ todo Android @todo Success { \"files\" : { \"/0/\" : \"QQ3QUdkJ2LCH4ycDjEMHQVHkhnMRiZhkncMCN1i4pbYSXD1heeq2DuNrdm3F\" } } The output gives us the key for the node at index 0 . There's only one key because this target node only contains one file. To add an actual file or directory, just specify a path, e.g, textile files add <thread> \"path/to/something\" . Let's try adding the same data again: cmd echo \"mmm, bytes...\" | textile files add <thread-id> JavaScript const block = await textile . files . add ( \"mmm, bytes...\" , \"\" , \"<thread-id>\" ) React Native const input = Buffer . from ( \"mmm, bytes...\" ). toString ( 'base64' ) const result = await textile . files . prepare ( input , \"<thread-id>\" ) const block = await textile . files . add ( result . dir , \"<thread-id>\" ) Objective-C NSString * threadId = @\"<thread-id>\" ; NSString * filePath = @\"/path/to/mmm-bytes....\" ; [ Textile . instance . files prepareByPath : filePath threadId : threadId completion : ^ ( MobilePreparedFiles * preparedFiles , NSError * error ) { if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { NSError * addFilesError ; [ Textile . instance . files add : preparedFiles . dir threadId : threadId caption : nil error : & addFilesError ]; if ( addFilesError ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } } }]; Swift let threadId = \"<thread-id>\" let filePath = \"/path/to/mmm-bytes....\" Textile . instance (). files . prepare ( byPath : filePath , threadId : threadId ) { ( preparedFiles , error ) in if let files = preparedFiles { var addFilesError : NSError ? Textile . instance (). files . add ( files . dir , threadId : threadId , caption : nil , error : & addFilesError ) if ( addFilesError != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } } else { // Do something with error } } Android final String threadId = \"<thread-id>\" ; String filePath = \"/path/to/mmm-bytes....\" ; Textile . instance (). files . prepareByPath ( filePath , threadId , new PreparedFilesHandler () { @Override public void onFilesPrepared ( MobilePreparedFiles preparedFiles ) { try { Textile . instance (). files . add ( preparedFiles . getDir (), threadId , null ); } catch ( Exception e ) { // Do something with this error } } @Override public void onError ( Exception e ) { // Do something with this error } }); Success { \"block\" : \"<block-id>\" , \"target\" : \"<block-target>\" , \"date\" : \"2019-06-11T06:44:05.535163Z\" , \"user\" : { \"address\" : \"<peer-address>\" , \"name\" : \"<peer-name>\" , \"avatar\" : \"<peer-avatar>\" }, \"files\" : [ { \"file\" : { \"mill\" : \"/blob\" , \"checksum\" : \"xxx\" , \"source\" : \"<source-ipfs-hash>\" , \"opts\" : \"xxx\" , \"hash\" : \"<result-ipfs-hash>\" , \"key\" : \"<encryption-key-for-result>\" , \"media\" : \"text/plain; charset=utf-8\" , \"name\" : \"stdin\" , \"size\" : \"14\" , \"added\" : \"2019-06-06T02:13:00.620280Z\" , \"meta\" : { }, \"targets\" : [ \"<block-target>\" ] } } ], \"comments\" : [ ], \"likes\" : [ ], \"threads\" : [ \"<thread-id>\" ] } Notice that the file target did not change . The peer was able to reuse the node from the prior addition because it detected that the same data was added via the same schema. This means that the input was not duplicated on the peer, even though it was encrypted non-deterministically. Info Good encryption is always non-deterministic, which means that re-encrypting the same input will always result in a different output. Make a photo album \u00b6 Now that you've got the hang of threads let's make something a little more interesting. Textile Photos uses threads to track your camera roll and shared photo albums using the built-in camera roll and media schemas. Let's create an open and shared thread for dog photos with the media schema: cmd textile threads add \"Dogs\" --type=\"open\" --sharing=\"shared\" --media JavaScript await textile . threads . add ( \"Dogs\" , \"media\" , \"your.bundle.id.version.Media\" , \"open\" , \"shared\" ) React Native const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.Media' const threadName = 'Dogs' const schema = { id : '' , json : '' , preset : AddThreadConfig .

This schema does not store the raw input data. Take a look at the built-in camera roll schema for an example of how you might do that, as well as extract exif data from an image.

So, your peer took some time to encode all of the requested sizes. Tip The /image/resize mill can take JPEG, PNG, and GIF images. Let's a look at the DAG node you just created. There will be three links, as defined by the schema: A DAG node created by the media schema. Info Notice that the media schema shown above only has \"pin\": true for the thumb node. In practice, this means that if you were registered with a cafe peer and were auto-syncing your threads, the other nodes (small and large) would be \"released\" and only the thumb node would remain stored locally. This functionality is similar to other cloud providers that only store low-res versions of your photos on device, but here you can define the behavior with a schema! By default, when you specify a directory path with the files add command, an update block will be added for each file. However, using the --group flag, we can create a single DAG \"folder\" and add it to the thread with a single update block. A DAG node created by the media schema using the --group flag. Track some GeoJSON coordinates \u00b6 Let's go through one more thread use case that demonstrates how to create a custom DAG schema. Additionally, we'll make use of a JSON schema for tracking JSON documents. Make a file named location.json with the following JSON document: { \"name\" : \"location\" , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"json_schema\" : { \"$id\" : \"https://example.com/geographical-location.schema.json\" , \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\" , \"title\" : \"Longitude and Latitude Values\" , \"description\" : \"A geographical coordinate.\" , \"required\" : [ \"latitude\" , \"longitude\" ], \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"latitude\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" , \"minimum\" : -90 , \"maximum\" : 90 }, \"longitude\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" , \"minimum\" : -180 , \"maximum\" : 180 } } } } Add a new thread to track your hypothetical runs: cmd textile threads add \"My runs\" --schema-file=~/Downloads/location.json --type=\"public\" --sharing=\"invite_only\" JavaScript const locations = ( await fetch ( \"location.json\" )). json () const thread = await textile . threads . add ( \"My runs\" , locations , \"your.bundle.id.version.MyRuns\" , \"public\" , \"invite_only\" ) React Native const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.MyRuns' const threadName = 'My Runs' const schema = { id : '' , json : JSON . stringify ( locations ), preset : AddThreadConfig .

Info \"Writes\" refer to messages and files, whereas \"annotations\" refer to comments and likes. For this tour, let's start another peer from a different wallet account. Below is a handy way to initialize an account peer for testing. If you are using any of the client libraries for the tour, use the CMD example from your terminal to run your second peer. cmd textile init \"$(textile wallet init | tail -n1)\" --repo=\"/tmp/buddy\" --swarm-ports=\"4101\" --api-bind-addr=\"127.0.0.1:41600\" --gateway-bind-addr=\"127.0.0.1:5150\" Success Initialized account with address P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs Hint We used non-default ports so that this peer won't collide with the first one.

This new account is not an existing contact. So, your peer will ask the network for its contact info. You can confirm that, yes, you'd like to add this account to your local contacts and send it an invite to your thread. Hint You just created an \"account-to-account\" invite, which is useful between existing account. \"External\" invites are useful when you want to invite a friend over another channel like SMS. See textile invites create --help for more. Next, we'll pretend that we are the second account and accept the invite. You should see a notification that you were invited to a thread in the daemon output. 23 Apr 19 14:08 PDT Clyde invited you to join QE5m1qw Before you accept, list your pending invites and grab the invite's ID: cmd textile invites list --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Success { \"items\" : [ { \"date\" : \"2019-04-23T21:08:29.285920Z\" , \"id\" : \"QmXcJmyX2vbeJTcZSkoZCHc74yycjJcXbxCHkLknJhyPaL\" , \"inviter\" : { \"address\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"avatar\" : \"Qmea7R7cCSSkRZ5Jammj8xvkE44YvjDWz3aBuWm4PNcyf5\" , \"name\" : \"Clyde\" }, \"name\" : \"My runs\" } ] } As expected, it looks like Clyde invited us to \"My runs\". Notice that we had to supply the --api flag to tell the command-line client to list invites from the non-default peer API. Tip You can avoid the need to use the --api when interacting with non-default peer APIs by exporting an environment variable, e.g., export API=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" . You could ignore the invite with textile invites ignore . However, we like Clyde and want to support his running efforts! cmd textile invites accept \"QmXcJmyX2vbeJTcZSkoZCHc74yycjJcXbxCHkLknJhyPaL\" --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Success { \"author\": \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\", \"date\": \"2019-04-23T21:32:22.486183Z\", \"id\": \"QmVoKpKsg5MkW11bK3LVmd3xMMaxTutVime32sV6EZWeLk\", \"parents\": [ \"QmUvWjstQzR6y7UctRJgVjcKsKzutZoiBsQw6WBXMnmg84\" ], \"thread\": \"12D3KooWBfdhD4tNMuTn5MHGof2bMZBKAUjFF3DBL3kuQQE5m1qw\", \"type\": \"JOIN\", \"user\": { \"address\": \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\", \"name\": \"P7X3gZu\" } } The output shows your \"join\" update in the thread.

Textile . instance (). invites . addExternal ( \"<thread-id>\" , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Textile . instance (). invites . addExternal ( \"<thread-id>\" ); Success { \"id\" : \"QmYzhyFhRGX3GBgsLMKoGrQqMWwPFKyPtsGmGbvma63zCf\" , \"inviter\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"key\" : \"cCBPKRN6723KkroCfMsLVHj3cbVkwpg47s5wdjyEPxXz6rRoo6mjBZqiizd\" } The only difference this time was that we didn't specify --address . Instead of getting sent directly to another peer, the invite was encrypted with the key shown in the output and persisted to IPFS. Now, you're free to send it around however you choose. In order to accept, the recipient has to specify the id and key : cmd textile invites accept \"QmYzhyFhRGX3GBgsLMKoGrQqMWwPFKyPtsGmGbvma63zCf\" --key=\"cCBPKRN6723KkroCfMsLVHj3cbVkwpg47s5wdjyEPxXz6rRoo6mjBZqiizd\" --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Success { \"author\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-24T00:03:09.432176Z\" , \"id\" : \"QmRBZmo9uxVfy1cfBkpRP5SqMGTdXyPwAYpMtBFUJtXjdD\" , \"parents\" : [ \"QmVPzdEQrcXJKMnCpvuUcTk8sz9LTVFuY4dB9HXX2B5jtg\" ], \"thread\" : \"12D3KooWExn4ut4RV2qHXFSiWb3AfhL2whB8vJgYpnDcmVCG7UBv\" , \"type\" : \"JOIN\" , \"user\" : { \"address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"name\" : \"P7X3gZu\" } } Of course, passing all these hashes and keys around is a lot easier with a well designed UI. The command-line client has a chat command that enters an interactive thread session in which participants can add and view messages. Start a chat on your first peer: cmd textile chat \"<thread-id>\" Then start the same chat on your second peer: cmd textile chat \"<thread-id>\" --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Tip Currently, the chat command doesn't work with Git Bash on Windows. To open an interactive thread session, run the aforementioned commands in the system shell ( cmd ) or Powershell instead. Clyde having a chat with a friend Chat away! The files API \u00b6 Applications will often want to paginate files and associated annotations in a thread. The files API lists update blocks that point to DAG nodes containing files. A JSON representation of the (decrypted) DAG node is attached to the response along with nested comments and likes. Try listing the files in your \"My runs\" thread: cmd textile thread files <thread-id> JavaScript await textile . files . list ( \"<thread-id>\" , undefined , 5 ) React Native await textile . files . list ( \"<thread-id>\" , \"\" , 5 ) Objective-C NSError * error ; FilesList * filesList = [ Textile . instance . files list : @\"<thread-id>\" offset : @\"\" limit : 5 error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let filesList = Textile . instance (). files . list ( \"<thread-id>\" , offset : \"\" , limit : 5 , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android FilesList files = Textile . instance (). files . list ( \"<thread-id>\" , \"\" , 5 ); Success { \"items\" : [{ \"block\" : \"QmUvWjstQzR6y7UctRJgVjcKsKzutZoiBsQw6WBXMnmg84\" , \"target\" : \"QmQVstxooDH7yJJzTrQySTCt61s46RjcGACsEmcLGz2dCk\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-23T20:08:51.686544Z\" , \"user\" : { \"address\" : \"P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j\" , \"name\" : \"Clyde\" , \"avatar\" : \"Qmea7R7cCSSkRZ5Jammj8xvkE44YvjDWz3aBuWm4PNcyf5\" }, \"files\" : [{ \"file\" : { \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"checksum\" : \"HoRmDDKwsQko2CWnrCoYHCw1rUaaPH3vW4EMcFMwtw3S\" , \"source\" : \"8XK5TuJcXmSQRGt1kfSoWXJtNhybpBLQsm4arMH9MpoQ\" , \"opts\" : \"G7x9bf74kcvU7aBVnToCMAeVhcsuxuHag8gKgav6cGcN\" , \"hash\" : \"QmQHYPJDQAU8ZaGG8e4iW9bj65mr2T1cwygyfWb6AUaNio\" , \"key\" : \"AYCbcQf4YDBHr4NE2SnBgZYPfTD5riZgerujv3xFZgZ4RhDP3yZjcMnHSqXp\" , \"media\" : \"application/json\" , \"size\" : \"43\" , \"added\" : \"2019-04-23T20:08:51.294649Z\" , \"meta\" : {}, \"targets\" : [ \"QmQVstxooDH7yJJzTrQySTCt61s46RjcGACsEmcLGz2dCk\" ] } }], \"comments\" : [{ \"id\" : \"QmNx9j82vWLF6tEeMYWdFMBDJo89yBbMmScseJR4jVtML3\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-23T22:21:04.253734Z\" , \"user\" : { \"address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"name\" : \"P7X3gZu\" }, \"body\" : \"Is this an outlier?\" }], \"likes\" : [], \"threads\" : [ \"12D3KooWBfdhD4tNMuTn5MHGof2bMZBKAUjFF3DBL3kuQQE5m1qw\" ] }] } You can also list files across all threads by omitting the --thread flag. The feed API \u00b6 The feed API provides a few different modes to drive feed-based UIs. Take a look at the usage text from the command-line client: textile feed --help Give the default chrono (for chronological) mode a try: cmd textile feed \"<thread-id>\" JavaScript await textile . feed . list ( \"<thread-id>\" ) React Native await textile . feed . list ( \"<thread-id>\" ) Objective-C FeedRequest * request = [[ FeedRequest alloc ] init ]; request . thread = @\"<thread-id>\" ; NSError * error ; FeedItemList * feedItemList = [ Textile . instance . feed list : request error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success!

Textile Photos uses the \"stacks\" mode. Subscription API \u00b6 The chat command we saw above is actually built in part with a subscription. You can subscribe to any type of thread update block : merge , ignore , flag , join , announce , leave , text , files , comment , like . Let's subscribe to \"files\" updates across all threads: cmd textile subscribe --type=\"files\" JavaScript // The js-http-client returns a `ReadableStream` to be accessed by the caller // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream for details const stream = await textile . subscribe . stream ( \"files\" ) const reader = stream . getReader () const read = ( result ) => { // ReadableStreamReadResult<FeedItem> if ( result . done ) { return } try { console . log ( result . value ) } catch ( err ) { reader . cancel ( undefined ) return } read ( await reader . read ()) } read ( await reader . read ()) React Native textile . events . addThreadUpdateReceivedListener (( update ) => { const { type_url } = update . payload if ( type_url === '/Files' ) { // new file! } }) Objective-C // Set the Textile delegate to any object that conforms to the TextileDelegate protocol Textile . instance . delegate = delegate ; // The delegate can receive callbacks for any event it is interested in, for example - ( void ) threadUpdateReceived: ( FeedItem * ) feedItem { if ([ feedItem . payload . typeURL isEqualToString : @\"/Files\" ]) { // new file! } } Swift // Set the Textile delegate to any object that conforms to the TextileDelegate protocol Textile . instance (). delegate = delegate // The delegate can receive callbacks for any event it is interested in, for example func threadUpdateReceived ( _ feedItem : FeedItem ) { if ( feedItem . payload . typeURL == \"/Files\" ) { // new file! } } Android // Add an event listener that conforms to TextileEventListener class MyEventListener extends BaseTextileEventListener { @Override public void threadUpdateReceived ( io . textile . pb .

Textile Photos uses a subscription to display realtime updates within its groups. Leave a thread \u00b6 When you leave a thread, all associated data is deleted from your peer. Additionally, all registered cafes will delete their associated snapshots. From your second peer, leave the \"My runs\" thread: cmd textile thread abandon \"<thread-id>\" --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Success ok Notifications \u00b6 Notifications are generated when you receive a thread invitation or update from another peer. OS-based notification APIs like iOS/Android local notifications or macOS desktop notifications can directly consume these objects. List notifications \u00b6 Let's see what kind of notifications your first peer (Clyde) has: cmd textile notifications ls JavaScript await textile . notifications . list () React Native const notifications = await textile . notifications . list () Objective-C NSError * error ; NotificationList * notifications = [ Textile . instance . notifications list : @\"0\" limit : 10 error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let notifications = Textile . instance (). notifications . list ( nil , limit : 10 , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android NotificationList notifications = Textile . instance (). notifications . list ( \"\" , 10 ); Success { \"items\" : [ { \"actor\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"block\" : \"QmPQSwoXQL5Hgmof3fYZQgp5GKwaqY4wbeP4NaoQe2P9vV\" , \"body\" : \"left\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-24T20:18:08.442121Z\" , \"id\" : \"1KKP01K9SpRASYKkyxSK4EiSYEz\" , \"subject\" : \"12D3KooWBfdhD4tNMuTn5MHGof2bMZBKAUjFF3DBL3kuQQE5m1qw\" , \"subject_desc\" : \"My runs\" , \"type\" : \"PEER_LEFT\" , \"user\" : { \"address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"name\" : \"P7X3gZu\" } } ] } Hmm, only one notification? Remember that your other peer left the \"My runs\" thread. Besides the leave notification, all others from their actions in that thread (joined, commented, etc.) were deleted. \"Read\" notifications \u00b6 Notifications have a read boolean status that is useful for some applications. We can mark the above notification as read via its id : cmd textile notifications read \"1KKP01K9SpRASYKkyxSK4EiSYEz\" JavaScript await textile . notifications . read ( \"1KKP01K9SpRASYKkyxSK4EiSYEz\" ) React Native await textile . notifications . read ( \"1KKP01K9SpRASYKkyxSK4EiSYEz\" ) Objective-C NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . notifications read : @\"1KKP01K9SpRASYKkyxSK4EiSYEz\" error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ?

Logs \u00b6 Your peer's underlying IPFS node comes with a rich system-based logging framework. Textile peers leverage this same framework, adding additional log systems with the prefix \"tex-\". View current log levels \u00b6 Take a look at the current log levels: cmd textile logs Success { \"addrutil\" : \"ERROR\" , \"autonat\" : \"ERROR\" , \"autonat-svc\" : \"ERROR\" , \"autorelay\" : \"ERROR\" , \"badger\" : \"ERROR\" , \"basichost\" : \"ERROR\" , \"bitswap\" : \"ERROR\" , \"bitswap_network\" : \"ERROR\" , \"blockservice\" : \"ERROR\" , \"blockstore\" : \"ERROR\" , \"boguskey\" : \"ERROR\" , \"bstestnet\" : \"ERROR\" , \"chunk\" : \"ERROR\" , \"cmds\" : \"ERROR\" , \"command\" : \"ERROR\" , \"connmgr\" : \"ERROR\" , \"core\" : \"ERROR\" , \"core/coreapi\" : \"ERROR\" , \"coreunix\" : \"ERROR\" , \"dht\" : \"ERROR\" , \"dht.pb\" : \"ERROR\" , \"discovery\" : \"ERROR\" , \"engine\" : \"ERROR\" , \"eventlog\" : \"ERROR\" , \"filestore\" : \"ERROR\" , \"flatfs\" : \"ERROR\" , \"fsrepo\" : \"ERROR\" , \"ipfsaddr\" : \"ERROR\" , \"ipns\" : \"ERROR\" , \"ipns-repub\" : \"ERROR\" , \"keystore\" : \"ERROR\" , \"lock\" : \"ERROR\" , \"mdns\" : \"ERROR\" , \"mfs\" : \"ERROR\" , \"mocknet\" : \"ERROR\" , \"mockrouter\" : \"ERROR\" , \"mount\" : \"ERROR\" , \"mplex\" : \"ERROR\" , \"namesys\" : \"ERROR\" , \"nat\" : \"ERROR\" , \"net/identify\" : \"ERROR\" , \"p2p-config\" : \"ERROR\" , \"p2p-mount\" : \"ERROR\" , \"pathresolv\" : \"ERROR\" , \"peerqueue\" : \"ERROR\" , \"peerstore\" : \"ERROR\" , \"pin\" : \"ERROR\" , \"ping\" : \"ERROR\" , \"plugin/loader\" : \"ERROR\" , \"provider\" : \"ERROR\" , \"providers\" : \"ERROR\" , \"pubsub\" : \"ERROR\" , \"pubsub-valuestore\" : \"ERROR\" , \"relay\" : \"ERROR\" , \"reprovider\" : \"ERROR\" , \"reuseport-transport\" : \"ERROR\" , \"routedhost\" : \"ERROR\" , \"routing/record\" : \"ERROR\" , \"secio\" : \"ERROR\" , \"stream-upgrader\" : \"ERROR\" , \"swarm2\" : \"ERROR\" , \"table\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tcp-tpt\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-broadcast\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-core\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-datastore\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-gateway\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-ipfs\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-main\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-mill\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-repo\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-repo-config\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-service\" : \"ERROR\" , \"tex-util\" : \"ERROR\" , \"transport\" : \"ERROR\" , \"ulimit\" : \"ERROR\" } They should all be at their default value of \"ERROR\". Note that you have access to all of the IPFS log systems as well. Change log levels \u00b6 You can alter a peer's log levels even when it's running. Tip During development, start the daemon with --debug . This will set all of the \"tex-\" log systems to \"DEBUG\". You can then tail the logs, like: tail -f \"path/to/repo/logs/textile.log\" . Set all of the \"tex-\" log systems to \"INFO\": cmd textile logs --level=\"info\" --tex-only Success { \"tex-broadcast\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-core\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-datastore\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-gateway\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-ipfs\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-main\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-mill\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-repo\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-repo-config\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-service\" : \"INFO\" , \"tex-util\" : \"INFO\" } Possible log level values are \"debug\", \"info\", \"warning\", \"error\", and \"critical\". See textile logs --help for more. Config \u00b6 When your peer starts, it loads a JSON config file from the repository directory, called \"textile\". This file lives alongside the IPFS config file (named \"config\"). You must restart your peer after making changes to either of these files. View a config value \u00b6 We can view the entire config or a specific value behind any JSON key. Try viewing the \"Addresses\" config: cmd textile config \"Addresses\" JavaScript const config = await textile . config . get ( \"Addresses\" ) Success { \"API\" : \"127.0.0.1:40600\" , \"CafeAPI\" : \"0.0.0.0:40601\" , \"Gateway\" : \"127.0.0.1:5050\" } textile config will display the entire file. Set a config value \u00b6 Changing values follows the same pattern. We can update our second peer's gateway bind address as follows: cmd textile config \"Addresses.Gateway\" \\\"127.0.0.1:9090\\\" JavaScript const config = await textile . config . set ( \"Addresses.Gateway\" , \"127.0.0.1:9090\" ) Success Updated! Restart daemon for changes to take effect. Restart the daemon (or your Textile instance for users of a mobile SDK): cmd textile daemon --repo=\"/tmp/buddy\" Success go-textile version: v0.1.12 Repo version: 13 Repo path: /Users/sander/.textile/repo API address: 127.0.0.1:40600 Gateway address: 127.0.0.1:5050 System version: amd64/darwin Golang version: go1.12.3 PeerID: 12D3KooWCMVLfMV8uzYpFN38qn2eMs48tAuHdVZdj3aF6nex6zay Account: P8wW5FYs2ANDan2DV8D45XWKtFFYNTMY8RgLCRcQHjyPZe5j You should now see the new gateway bind address in the config: cmd textile config JavaScript const config = await textile . config . get () Success { \"API\" : { \"HTTPHeaders\" : { \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\" : [ \"Content-Type\" , \"Method\" , \"X-Textile-Args\" , \"X-Textile-Opts\" , \"X-Requested-With\" ], \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\" : [ \"GET\" , \"POST\" , \"DELETE\" , \"OPTIONS\" ], \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" : [ \"http://localhost:*\" , \"http://127.0.0.1:*\" ], \"Server\" : [ \"go-textile/0.1.12\" ] }, \"SizeLimit\" : 0 }, \"Account\" : { \"Address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"Thread\" : \"12D3KooWLMV52tB3kP7qeRwrwfHQpaZZFaMnAm2wEwroY6xBsPwB\" }, \"Addresses\" : { \"API\" : \"127.0.0.1:41600\" , \"CafeAPI\" : \"127.0.0.1:40601\" , \"Gateway\" : \"127.0.0.1:9090\" }, \"Cafe\" : { \"Client\" : { \"Mobile\" : { \"P2PWireLimit\" : 0 } }, \"Host\" : { \"NeighborURL\" : \"\" , \"Open\" : false , \"SizeLimit\" : 0 , \"URL\" : \"\" } }, \"IsMobile\" : false , \"IsServer\" : false , \"Logs\" : { \"LogToDisk\" : true }, \"Threads\" : { \"Defaults\" : { \"ID\" : \"\" } } } Cafe Hosts \u00b6 Cafe peers (or just cafes) provide services to other peers. Cafes are easy to deploy and manage (single executable, Docker). Checkout the full guide if you're interested in hosting your own. For the purposes of this tour, let's transform your second peer into a local cafe. A production cafe should be run on a publicly accessible host, but a local cafe is useful for development and testing. On your second peer, open the cafe API by setting the config key \"Cafe.Host.Open\" to true : cmd textile config \"Cafe.Host.Open\" true --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Success Updated! Restart daemon for changes to take effect. Now, restart the daemon in debug mode: cmd textile daemon --repo=\"/tmp/buddy\" --debug Success go-textile version: v0.1.12 Repo version: 13 Repo path: /tmp/buddy API address: 127.0.0.1:41600 Gateway address: 127.0.0.1:9090 Cafe address: 0.0.0.0:40601 System version: amd64/darwin Golang version: go1.12.3 PeerID: 12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV Account: P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs Note that Cafe address: 0.0.0.0:40601 is now shown after restarting the daemon. Create a client token \u00b6 In order for clients to register with your cafe, they'll need one of its client tokens . Info Cafe client tokens are generated from cryptographically secure random bytes, salted, hashed, and stored locally. You can think of them as very strong passwords. Create a token as follows: cmd textile tokens create --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" JavaScript const token = await textile . tokens . create () Success bYJLFjHsRsZjdzEwC2pJwQthmfYb3DPYyBCcU49Dkfqd5xGHk5NR77X8GDKG View client tokens \u00b6 View the cafe's client tokens with the ls command: cmd textile tokens ls --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" JavaScript const tokens = await textile . tokens . list () Success [ \"2ZwjtRaFj6kMxnKm3BLnueqaT3WLXQS3evEZoJ87oZLUMhdNxr4sVKorUWSu3ZHgfBbyU726trkqSnsvLGmiJ8bpv5PEqqSf25f\" ] The value shown in the list is the salted and hashed token. The plaintext version needed by a registering client is only available at creation time as they are never stored by the cafe. Cafe Clients \u00b6 Cafes perform work for their clients , which are account peers. Account peers don't need to be registered with a cafe, but doing so has advantages, like improving discovery of its content and providing an inbox for messages received offline. See the cafe service section for more about how cafes assist other peers on the network. Tip Textile hosts a development cafe that you are free to use for non-production purposes. More details can be found here . Register with a cafe \u00b6 Using the token created above, register with your locally running test cafe: cmd textile cafes add <cafe-peer-id> --token=\"bYJLFjHsRsZjdzEwC2pJwQthmfYb3DPYyBCcU49Dkfqd5xGHk5NR77X8GDKG\" JavaScript const token = \"bYJLFjHsRsZjdzEwC2pJwQthmfYb3DPYyBCcU49Dkfqd5xGHk5NR77X8GDKG\" const success = await textile . cafes . add ( \"<cafe-peer-id>\" , token ) Success { \"access\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzY29wZXMiOiJhY2Nlc3MiLCJhdWQiOiIvdGV4dGlsZS9jYWZlLzEuMC4wIiwiZXhwIjoxNTU4OTk2NDcxLCJqdGkiOiIxS1luQ1doOXRkOU1abjVrdUtIYnJjR0NPRlkiLCJpYXQiOjE1NTY1NzcyNzEsImlzcyI6IjEyRDNLb29XOXlhQUx4eGszMW5uYVBaQjl0emp3eEZ5UFVCcndMdUNYWjNGbkFXZzhWeVYiLCJzdWIiOiIxMkQzS29vV0NNVkxmTVY4dXpZcEZOMzhxbjJlTXM0OHRBdUhkVlpkajNhRjZuZXg2emF5In0.j9N-AGVZhU5-eTSOm6fkZkKVsAeTSrPXjx3BmyZoB4gKG_T2G3g0iSB1n2Bz0ZWEre8gt6xRGA3yL0bMUw-dAw\" , \"cafe\" : { \"address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"api\" : \"v0\" , \"node\" : \"0.1.12\" , \"peer\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"protocol\" : \"/textile/cafe/1.0.0\" , \"url\" : \"http://127.0.0.1:40601\" }, \"exp\" : \"2019-05-27T22:34:31.142527Z\" , \"id\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"refresh\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzY29wZXMiOiJyZWZyZXNoIiwiYXVkIjoiL3RleHRpbGUvY2FmZS8xLjAuMCIsImV4cCI6MTU2MTQxNTY3MSwianRpIjoicjFLWW5DV2g5dGQ5TVpuNWt1S0hicmNHQ09GWSIsImlhdCI6MTU1NjU3NzI3MSwiaXNzIjoiMTJEM0tvb1c5eWFBTHh4azMxbm5hUFpCOXR6and4RnlQVUJyd0x1Q1haM0ZuQVdnOFZ5ViIsInN1YiI6IjEyRDNLb29XQ01WTGZNVjh1ellwRk4zOHFuMmVNczQ4dEF1SGRWWmRqM2FGNm5leDZ6YXkifQ.erefmNinE3C1xpSa73TU6qJmTDLrjXtBh8-cojZ-D2_t6VrklYfffGGJLCQ7DKRv3UANS03U2KVX6WjH3GZADw\" , \"rexp\" : \"2019-06-24T22:34:31.142527Z\" , \"subject\" : \"12D3KooWCMVLfMV8uzYpFN38qn2eMs48tAuHdVZdj3aF6nex6zay\" , \"type\" : \"JWT\" } A new client account associated with the provided token was added to your cafe. Your account peer now has an active cafe session which it can use to make authenticated requests. Cafe sessions are stateless JWT objects that can expire. Tip An account peer may be registered with more than one cafe, and account peers do not need to be registered to the same cafe(s). Additionally, peers can easily migrate from one cafe to another, simply be deregistering from one and registering with another. List cafe sessions \u00b6 You can view your active cafe sessions with the ls command: cmd textile cafes ls JavaScript const sessions = await textile . cafes . list () Objective-C NSError * error ; CafeSessionList * sessions = [ Textile . instance . cafes sessions : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let sessions = Textile . instance (). cafes . sessions (& error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android CafeSessionList sessions = Textile . instance (). cafes . sessions (); Success { \"items\" : [ { \"access\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzY29wZXMiOiJhY2Nlc3MiLCJhdWQiOiIvdGV4dGlsZS9jYWZlLzEuMC4wIiwiZXhwIjoxNTU4OTk2NDcxLCJqdGkiOiIxS1luQ1doOXRkOU1abjVrdUtIYnJjR0NPRlkiLCJpYXQiOjE1NTY1NzcyNzEsImlzcyI6IjEyRDNLb29XOXlhQUx4eGszMW5uYVBaQjl0emp3eEZ5UFVCcndMdUNYWjNGbkFXZzhWeVYiLCJzdWIiOiIxMkQzS29vV0NNVkxmTVY4dXpZcEZOMzhxbjJlTXM0OHRBdUhkVlpkajNhRjZuZXg2emF5In0.j9N-AGVZhU5-eTSOm6fkZkKVsAeTSrPXjx3BmyZoB4gKG_T2G3g0iSB1n2Bz0ZWEre8gt6xRGA3yL0bMUw-dAw\" , \"cafe\" : { \"address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"api\" : \"v0\" , \"node\" : \"0.1.12\" , \"peer\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"protocol\" : \"/textile/cafe/1.0.0\" , \"url\" : \"http://127.0.0.1:40601\" }, \"exp\" : \"2019-05-27T22:34:31.142527Z\" , \"id\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"refresh\" : \"eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzY29wZXMiOiJyZWZyZXNoIiwiYXVkIjoiL3RleHRpbGUvY2FmZS8xLjAuMCIsImV4cCI6MTU2MTQxNTY3MSwianRpIjoicjFLWW5DV2g5dGQ5TVpuNWt1S0hicmNHQ09GWSIsImlhdCI6MTU1NjU3NzI3MSwiaXNzIjoiMTJEM0tvb1c5eWFBTHh4azMxbm5hUFpCOXR6and4RnlQVUJyd0x1Q1haM0ZuQVdnOFZ5ViIsInN1YiI6IjEyRDNLb29XQ01WTGZNVjh1ellwRk4zOHFuMmVNczQ4dEF1SGRWWmRqM2FGNm5leDZ6YXkifQ.erefmNinE3C1xpSa73TU6qJmTDLrjXtBh8-cojZ-D2_t6VrklYfffGGJLCQ7DKRv3UANS03U2KVX6WjH3GZADw\" } ] } Check messages \u00b6 An account peer will periodically check each of its registered cafes for new messages received by the cafe on its behalf. You can also manually check for messages: cmd textile cafes messages JavaScript const success = await textile . cafes . messages () Objective-C NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . cafes checkMessages : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? Textile . instance (). cafes . checkMessages (& error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Textile . instance (). cafes . checkMessages (); Success ok Messages are downloaded in batches and queued for processing. This enables cafes to receive messages on an account peer's behalf when it is offline. Unregister with a cafe \u00b6 You can leave a cafe at any time. Data associated with your client account will be removed. cmd textile cafes rm \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" JavaScript const success = await textile . cafes . remove ( \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" ) Objective-C NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . cafes deregister : @\"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? Textile . instance (). cafes . deregister ( \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Textile . instance (). cafes . deregister ( \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" ); Success ok Info Cafes are anonymous and disposable infrastructure, meaning that you can replace one cafe with another and still participate in the network as before. IPFS \u00b6 The Textile API exposes a handful of the more useful IPFS endpoints. For the command-line client, these are id , cat , swarm peers , and swarm connect . Please open an issue or pull request for other IPFS APIs you would like to use via textile . View peer ID \u00b6 At some point, you will want to view your IPFS peer ID. This is the same ID shown in your contact and profile info and printed by the daemon on startup: cmd textile ipfs id JavaScript const id = await textile . ipfs . id () Success 12D3KooWCMVLfMV8uzYpFN38qn2eMs48tAuHdVZdj3aF6nex6zay See the IPFS doc for more info. Check out this post on the Textile blog for more info about how peers identify each other on the distributed web. View the peer swarm \u00b6 Your peer is always communicating, or \"gossiping\", with a changing sub-set of other peers on the IPFS network called a \"swarm\". You can view that swarm at any time. It should be relatively large at this point since your peer has been \"online\" for awhile. cmd textile ipfs swarm peers JavaScript const peers = await textile . ipfs . peers () Success { \"Peers\" :

Connect to another peer \u00b6 You may also want to check or open a connection to another peer. You can do this by supplying a complete multi-address . Try connecting to one of Textile's federated cafe peers: cmd textile ipfs swarm connect \"/ip4/18.224.173.65/tcp/4001/ipfs/12D3KooWLh9Gd4C3knv4XqCyCuaNddfEoSLXgekVJzRyC5vsjv5d\" JavaScript const success = await textile . ipfs . connect ( \"/ip4/18.224.173.65/tcp/4001/ipfs/12D3KooWLh9Gd4C3knv4XqCyCuaNddfEoSLXgekVJzRyC5vsjv5d\" ) Success [ \"connect 12D3KooWLh9Gd4C3knv4XqCyCuaNddfEoSLXgekVJzRyC5vsjv5d success\" ] See the IPFS doc for more info. Cat any data on the network \u00b6 Downloading data behind a path is one of the most useful IPFS APIs. For example, we can \"cat\" an unencrypted Textile logo into a PNG file: cmd textile ipfs cat \"QmarZwQEri4g2s8aw9CWKhxAzmg6rnLawGuSGYLSASEow6/0/d\" > textile.png JavaScript const logo = await textile . ipfs . cat ( \"QmarZwQEri4g2s8aw9CWKhxAzmg6rnLawGuSGYLSASEow6/0/d\" ) Objective-C NSError * error ; NSData * data = [ Textile . instance . ipfs dataAtPath : @\"QmarZwQEri4g2s8aw9CWKhxAzmg6rnLawGuSGYLSASEow6/0/d\" error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let data = Textile . instance (). ipfs . data ( atPath : \"QmarZwQEri4g2s8aw9CWKhxAzmg6rnLawGuSGYLSASEow6/0/d\" , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android byte [] data = Textile . instance (). ipfs . dataAtPath ( \"QmarZwQEri4g2s8aw9CWKhxAzmg6rnLawGuSGYLSASEow6/0/d\" ); Success See the IPFS doc for more info. IPFS Gateway \u00b6 All desktop and server peers host an IPFS gateway. Read more and see some examples here . A gateway to the gateways Textile hosts a number of federated cafe peers around the globe, each with a public-facing gateway. A latency-based load balancer ties them all together at https://gateway.textile.cafe , which you are free to use in your applications. This is a dynamically decrypted image. Gateways will attempt to decrypt data with a key passed as a query parameter. Photo by Jan Tinneberg on Unsplash. Thank you for taking the tour! \ud83d\udc4b .

The peer created a new DAG node (a textile block) for the input as defined by the schema. Every schema step adds a child node with two links: The target shown in the output is the root hash of the DAG. meta : A JSON object containing metadata about the input and how it was processed. Which is the success output of the previosu command. content : The content of the file that was added, in the above command output, this is at .files[0].hash , and can be fetched via textile file get <hash> --content , or via textile file block get <block-id> --content . The files guide covers these concepts in more detail. Unless a schema step specifies \"plaintext\": true , the value of meta and content are both encrypted with the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) using their very own symmetric key. We can view the keys for each node in the DAG using the keys command: cmd textile files keys \"<block-target>\" JavaScript const keys = await textile . files . keys ( \"<block-target>\" ) React Native @ todo Objective-C @ todo Swift @ todo Android @todo Success { \"files\" : { \"/0/\" : \"QQ3QUdkJ2LCH4ycDjEMHQVHkhnMRiZhkncMCN1i4pbYSXD1heeq2DuNrdm3F\" } } The output gives us the key for the node at index 0 . There's only one key because this target node only contains one file. To add an actual file or directory, just specify a path, e.g, textile files add <thread> \"path/to/something\" .

The peer was able to reuse the node from the prior addition because it detected that the same data was added via the same schema. This means that the input was not duplicated on the peer, even though it was encrypted non-deterministically. Info Good encryption is always non-deterministic, which means that re-encrypting the same input will always result in a different output.","title":"Add some data"},{"location":"a-tour-of-textile/#make-a-photo-album","text":"Now that you've got the hang of threads let's make something a little more interesting.

This schema does not store the raw input data. Take a look at the built-in camera roll schema for an example of how you might do that, as well as extract exif data from an image.

So, your peer took some time to encode all of the requested sizes. Tip The /image/resize mill can take JPEG, PNG, and GIF images. Let's a look at the DAG node you just created. There will be three links, as defined by the schema: A DAG node created by the media schema. Info Notice that the media schema shown above only has \"pin\": true for the thumb node. In practice, this means that if you were registered with a cafe peer and were auto-syncing your threads, the other nodes (small and large) would be \"released\" and only the thumb node would remain stored locally. This functionality is similar to other cloud providers that only store low-res versions of your photos on device, but here you can define the behavior with a schema! By default, when you specify a directory path with the files add command, an update block will be added for each file. However, using the --group flag, we can create a single DAG \"folder\" and add it to the thread with a single update block. A DAG node created by the media schema using the --group flag.","title":"Make a photo album"},{"location":"a-tour-of-textile/#track-some-geojson-coordinates","text":"Let's go through one more thread use case that demonstrates how to create a custom DAG schema.

As before, we need to create an invite and accept it.

Instead of getting sent directly to another peer, the invite was encrypted with the key shown in the output and persisted to IPFS. Now, you're free to send it around however you choose. In order to accept, the recipient has to specify the id and key : cmd textile invites accept \"QmYzhyFhRGX3GBgsLMKoGrQqMWwPFKyPtsGmGbvma63zCf\" --key=\"cCBPKRN6723KkroCfMsLVHj3cbVkwpg47s5wdjyEPxXz6rRoo6mjBZqiizd\" --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Success { \"author\" : \"12D3KooW9yaALxxk31nnaPZB9tzjwxFyPUBrwLuCXZ3FnAWg8VyV\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-24T00:03:09.432176Z\" , \"id\" : \"QmRBZmo9uxVfy1cfBkpRP5SqMGTdXyPwAYpMtBFUJtXjdD\" , \"parents\" : [ \"QmVPzdEQrcXJKMnCpvuUcTk8sz9LTVFuY4dB9HXX2B5jtg\" ], \"thread\" : \"12D3KooWExn4ut4RV2qHXFSiWb3AfhL2whB8vJgYpnDcmVCG7UBv\" , \"type\" : \"JOIN\" , \"user\" : { \"address\" : \"P7X3gZus5H15tWCxk4oP6EVsgAM9vwUfCyepAKw49QuRyPYs\" , \"name\" : \"P7X3gZu\" } } Of course, passing all these hashes and keys around is a lot easier with a well designed UI. The command-line client has a chat command that enters an interactive thread session in which participants can add and view messages. Start a chat on your first peer: cmd textile chat \"<thread-id>\" Then start the same chat on your second peer: cmd textile chat \"<thread-id>\" --api=\"http://127.0.0.1:41600\" Tip Currently, the chat command doesn't work with Git Bash on Windows.

While interoperable with the whole IPFS peer-to-peer network, Textile-flavored peers represent an additional layer or sub-network of users, applications, and services . With good encryption defaults and anonymous, disposable application services like cafes , Textile aims to bring the decentralized internet to real products that people love. The network How it works \u00b6 Textile peers use p2p messaging patterns to orchestrate shared datasets, or more specifically your chats, contacts, albums, and more. With iCloud or another major cloud provider, you expect these datasets to be synced across your iOS devices. Additionally, if you've shared a dataset like a playlist or photo album with other users, you would expect changes to be synced with their devices as well. You can expect the same with Textile, but without the centralized control of a single organization or government. A traditional cloud provider will store your datasets in one, maybe a few, central location(s). This means that you must trust the provider won't decide to drop your access, and in some cases, to not view or expose the contents of your datasets. In Textile, these types of datasets are called threads . At the core of every thread is a secret. Only peers that possess the secret are able to decrypt thread content or follow linkages. Hint Unlike a blockchain, threads are not based around the idea of consensus. Instead, they follow an agent-centric approach similar to holochain . Each peer has authority over thread access-control and storage. Because threads are simply a hash-chain of update messages, or blocks , they can represent any type of dataset. Some blocks point to off-chain data stored on IPFS. For example, a set of photos, a PDF, or even an entire website. Application developers are able to add structure to threads and make them interoperable with other applications by using schemas . Threads are auto-magically synced with other account peers. For example, you may have one peer on your phone, and another on your laptop, both with access to the same account seed (more about accounts here ). Threads can also be shared with other non-account peers (other users). In any case, each peer maintains a copy of its threads. A p2p messaging protocol keeps all the copies in sync. The special hash-chain or graph structure of a thread allows them to be easily shared with other peers and backed-up to cafes . Given one message, you can find all the others. Let's look a little closer at the different actors on the network. Account Peers \u00b6 User account peers share access to a single account from a data wallet . You can think of the wallet as a collection of thread secrets. Account peers typically run on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices and expose APIs for encrypting, storing, and sharing files/data/messages, among other functions. Account peers will automatically stay in sync. Read more about account sync here . Cafe Peers \u00b6 Cafe peers (or just cafes) are anonymous and disposable infrastructure. They provide services on behalf of users and applications without requiring trust . For example, once an account peer is registered with a cafe,\u001f all of its local (default encrypted) data is automatically synced (pinned). encrypted thread snapshots (HEAD) are automatically synced for new device sign-in and recovery. it will have an always-online message inbox for receiving thread updates from other peers when offline. its contact info will be indexed and made available for search on the network. Unlike account peers, cafes need to be online at all times in order to function properly. For this reason, they typically run in a server environment. They are easy to deploy & manage (single executable, Docker). Tip An account peer may be registered with more than one cafe, and account peers do not need to be registered to the same cafe(s). Additionally, peers can easily migrate from one cafe to another, simply be deregistering from one and registering with another. Applications \u00b6 Finally, applications run alongside or include an account peer and can create and/or access their data. Textile maintains a few reference apps like Textile Photos for desktop and mobile. Check out the client SDKs for information on how to leverage an account peer in your application. Why IPFS? \u00b6 IPFS is the perfect file system for Textile for a few reasons: IPFS uses content-addressed data , meaning that content can be requested from the network as a whole by an immutable address , rather than from a single host with an arbitrary URL. This stands in the way of censorship and opens the door to Textile's decentralized, recoverable, and cross-application data storage. IPFS ships with a libp2p host, which is the best-in-class peer-to-peer networking library. Textile believes that IPFS is the distributed web of the future.

They provide services on behalf of users and applications. Access to cafe services is granted via JWT-based sessions, and initial registration with a cafe requires an access token. Any peer can operate as a cafe, though they work best for always-on peers. Cafes run an 'extra' network API that handles client and host requests over libp2p or HTTP. Tip An account peer may be registered with more than one cafe, and account peers do not need to be registered to the same cafe(s). Additionally, peers can easily migrate from one cafe to another, simply be deregistering from one and registering with another. Services \u00b6 Backup \u00b6 One of the primary functions of a cafe is to provide a recovery and new device sign-in mechanism to its clients . Once registered with a cafe, clients' data (which is, by default, encrypted) is automatically synced. This involves a combination of authenticated IPFS pinning and thread snapshots. A thread snapshot contains only the metadata and latest known update hash (HEAD) needed to reconstruct the entire thread from scratch, and is encrypted with the client's account key. This means that cafes only issue encrypted backups and are not able to read their clients' threads. This also means that the snapshots are useless if a client loses their account key. Message inbox-ing \u00b6 Very often, a peer is not online or is otherwise unreachable and therefore unable to receive a message (usually a thread update message, or block ). In this failed state, the sender can send the message to the recipient's always-online cafe(s), ensuring the message is delivered when the recipient returns online. In practice, this means that, when available, cafe \"inbox\" addresses are attached to contacts , which get published to the network. This is sort of like your phone's voicemail service, but here you're in control of where the message is actually delivered. Most importantly, because the update messages are encrypted, you do not need to trust the cafe hosting the inbox. User account indexing \u00b6 Textile provides tooling for certain types of network-wide queries , like user account search. Changes to a peer's public-facing contact are indexed and made query-able by its cafes. So, while you do not need to be registered with a cafe in order to leverage these queries, doing so may increase your chances of being discovered by others, assuming you local peer is periodically offline. Web endpoints \u00b6 IPFS gateway \u00b6 All desktop and server peers host an IPFS gateway. However, the gateway is most useful on a cafe peer where clients' content is stored.

Textile account key derivation from a BIP39 mnemonic. Every account seed \"inside\" the wallet can be derived from this mnemonic phrase. Meaning that the wallet effectively is the mnemonic phrase. Any given wallet may create an arbitrary number of accounts. For example, a single wallet can be used to provision multiple Textile Photos \"accounts\", each with a completely different persona. This provides a powerful partitioning framework. Textile account seeds (private keys) always starts with an \"S\" for \"secret\" and account addresses (public keys) always start with a \"P\" for \"public\". Hint Peer initialization does not (by design) use the whole wallet, just one account seed. Users and applications are free to use any seed from their wallet, but most use cases will just make use of the seed from the default account, or account 0 . This BIP39 mnemonic explorer can be helpful when learning about HD wallets: https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ .

The special hash-chain or graph structure of a thread allows them to be easily shared with other peers and backed-up to cafes . Given one message, you can find all the others. Requirements \u00b6 Threads are supposed to serve a decentralized cloud-like function for safely storing and retrieving data generated by applications for users, i.e., photos, messages, contacts, health data, etc. They were designed with the following requirements in mind: Conflict resistant: Similar to ipfs-log , a thread should facilitate a resilient, distributed state, shared among multiple members (and/or devices). Mud puddle resistant: There should be a way to safely backup a thread's state such that the owner can recover it. Offline-first: Because most people access the internet primarily from mobile devices, threads must enable a UX that works well in scenarios where connectivity is spotty, and peers are continually coming and going from the network. Secure: Peers must sign updates and encrypted with the shared key. Ideally, linkages should also be obscured by encryption. Implementation \u00b6 On the one hand, threads is a data model for representing a dataset as a hash-chain of updates. On the other hand, it's a protocol for orchestrating that state between peers. Info Threads aim to be language and platform agnostic. For this reason, Textile uses protocol buffers extensively because they are a \"language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data\". Model \u00b6 message Thread { string id = 1 ; string key = 2 ; bytes sk = 3 ; string name = 4 ; string schema = 5 ; string initiator = 6 ; Type type = 7 ; Sharing sharing = 8 ; repeated string whitelist = 9 ; State state = 10 ; string head = 11 ; // Type controls read (R), annotate (A), and write (W) access enum Type { PRIVATE = 0 ; // initiator: RAW, whitelist: READ_ONLY = 1 ; // initiator: RAW, whitelist: R PUBLIC = 2 ; // initiator: RAW, whitelist: RA OPEN = 3 ; // initiator: RAW, whitelist: RAW } // Sharing controls if (Y/N) a thread can be shared enum Sharing { NOT_SHARED = 0 ; // initiator: N, whitelist: N INVITE_ONLY = 1 ; // initiator: Y, whitelist: N SHARED = 2 ; // initiator: Y, whitelist: Y } // State indicates the loading state enum State { LOADING_TAIL = 0 ; // tail blocks are being loaded LOADED = 1 ; // blocks are all loaded / paused LOADING_HEAD = 2 ; // head block is being loaded } // view info Block head_block = 101 ; Node schema_node = 102 ; int32 block_count = 103 ; int32 peer_count = 104 ; } Orchestration \u00b6 The orchestration of thread state between peers can be thought of as syncing a graph of blocks and files , which involves sending outbound updates and reading inbound updates. In practice, this is handled by a libp2p service. Info The thread service's protocol ID is /textile/threads/<version> . Outbound updates \u00b6 A block describing an update to a thread is signed with the author's private key and encrypted with the thread secret. The resulting message is then sent over directly to known participants. If a peer is offline, the message is again encrypted with their public key and delivered to their cafe inbox(es) . Inbound updates \u00b6 Upon receiving an update, either directly or from a cafe inbox , a peer will decrypt, verify, and locally index the inner block . Depending on thread behavior, the peer will follow the graph, downloading linked messages from the network until it no longer finds new blocks. Ideally, the update can be fast-forwarded merged, but a deterministic 3-way merge may be needed. Files DAG node referenced by the graph also need to be synced. Sync is handled by first downloading the thread's schema, which contains pinning (storage) instructions for the DAG's inner files. Finally, a peer may send back an acknowledgment to the author containing its latest graph tip (or HEAD in git terminology) if it believes they have diverged. Account Threads \u00b6 Account peers can instruct each other to create and delete threads by communicating over a special internal account thread. An additional signature is used to handle this on outbound updates, which differentiates account and non-account peer messages. The account thread is used to track account peers, profile information, and known contacts. Like normal threads, it is kept in sync between account peers. Read more about account sync here . Snapshots \u00b6 Thread snapshots enable account sync , recovery, and login from new devices. Snapshots are an encrypted representation of a thread. They contain metadata and the latest update hash, which is usually stored by cafes . Account peers will continuously search for, decrypt, and apply one another's snapshots to their local thread state. Access Control \u00b6 Control over thread access and sharing is handled by a combination of the type and sharing settings. An immutable member address \"whitelist\" gives the initiator fine-grained control. The table below outlines access patterns for the thread initiator and the whitelist members. An empty whitelist is taken to be \"everyone\", which is the default. Thread type controls read (R), annotate (A), and write (W) access: private --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: read_only --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: R public --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: RA open --> initiator: RAW, whitelist: RAW Thread sharing style controls if (Y/N) a thread can be shared: not_shared --> initiator: N, whitelist: N invite_only --> initiator: Y, whitelist: N shared --> initiator: Y, whitelist: Y` Info Access control will be moving to a more familiar, role-based design in a future release. See this GitHub issue for more. Blocks \u00b6 Blocks are the raw components of a thread. Think of them as an append-only log of thread updates where each one is hash-linked to its parent(s), forming a tree. New / recovering peers can sync history by merely traversing the hash tree. In practice, blocks are small (encrypted) protocol buffers , linked together by their IPFS CID (content id or hash). You can explore the protocol buffer definitions here . There are several block types: - MERGE: 3-way merge added. - IGNORE: A block was ignored. - FLAG: A block was flagged. - JOIN: Peer joined. - ANNOUNCE: Peer set username / avatar / inbox addresses - LEAVE: Peer left. - TEXT: Text message added. - FILES: File(s) added. - COMMENT: Comment added to another block. - LIKE: Like added to another block. Tip The Blocks API can serve Graphviz dot files which can be converted to an image as seen below. See textile blocks --help for more) A chat thread An account thread shared between eight peers Files \u00b6 The FILES block type points to off-thread data in the form of an IPLD merkle DAG. These DAGs are described by and validated against the thread's schema . Hint Any data added to a thread ends up as a file , regardless of whether or not the source data was an actual file. For example, echoing a string into a thread results in a \"file\" containing that string. Read more about files in the next section . V2 Roadmap \u00b6 Work on the next version of threads (v2) has started. The goals and individual issues for the next version can be seen here . The high-level goals have been copied below: Move to a standalone GitHub repository. Add the notion of \"intent\" to the data model so that other applications can understand a threads intended purpose. Replace the protocol buffer based linkages with IPLD so other programs can more easily traverse threads. Use a hybrid p2p and gossipsub orchestration pattern (details to come). Break HEAD into multiple categories (peers, content, annotations) Move to a role-based access model for accounts and applications. Encrypt thread snapshots with one-off keys that can be provisioned w/ rolls. Allow threads to be searchable and \"followed\" from a gateway. Support a more traditional \"feed\" mechanism (1->many vs. some->some). Use a single AES key as the thread secret, hash of key as ID. In addition to being governed by access role, peers should not be required to download thread history. Local thread interactions should use the more human-readable key and not id. Feedback welcome! Please let us know if you want to weigh in on the next version of threads.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"concepts/threads/#requirements","text":"Threads are supposed to serve a decentralized cloud-like function for safely storing and retrieving data generated by applications for users, i.e., photos, messages, contacts, health data, etc. They were designed with the following requirements in mind: Conflict resistant: Similar to ipfs-log , a thread should facilitate a resilient, distributed state, shared among multiple members (and/or devices).

Most of the time, a schema is used to define one or more types of data in a thread such that other users and applications can understand it. Currently, the following input types are available: Raw data blobs, images, EXIF data, and JSON documents. Structure \u00b6 Thread data is built into an IPLD merkle DAG structure (similar to a merkle tree ) and stored separately from update blocks on IPFS. A FILES block points to the top-level hash of a file's DAG node. The structure of files DAG nodes are determined by, and validated against, a schema . A thread can have only one schema . It has two main functions: Define a Thread's data DAG structure Define the order of mills (transforms) needed to produce this structure from the input To illustrate these functions, take a look at the builtin media schema. Each link ( large , small , thumb ) produces a resized and encrypted image by leveraging the image/resize mill. Notice that the thumb link uses the large as input. This means that large will need to milled before thumb . Once you understand how schemas and mills work, you can design complex workflows and structures for your applications. In addition to the transformed bytes, a mill will produce a file metadata object for every input: message FileMeta { string mill = 1 ; // Mill used to process the file (e.g., `/image/resize`, `/json`) string checksum = 2 ; // Pre-milled (md5) checksum of the input file string source = 3 ; // Source file CID string opts = 4 ; // md5 checksum of input mill options string hash = 5 ; // CID hash of milled file string key = 6 ; // AES encryption key string media = 7 ; // Media type (e.g., `'application/json'`, `'image/jpeg'`) string name = 8 ; // Name of the input file int64 size = 9 ; // Size of the milled file in bytes google . protobuf . Timestamp added = 10 ; // Date the file was added to the thread google . protobuf . Struct meta = 11 ; // Additional metadata repeated string targets = 12 ; // DAG targets the file belongs to (kept only by the local peer) } File metadata objects are what most applications will interact with. They are the objects listed by the Files and Feed APIs. These objects are also used internally for various functions. For example, because good encryption is not deterministic, an input's checksum is used to de-duplicate encrypted data. At this point, it should be clear that adding data to a thread results in a DAG defined by a schema. But how exactly is the data stored so as to be programmatically accessible to thread consumers? Let's take a closer look at the DAG produced by the builtin media schema... A DAG node created by the built-in \"media\" schema. Note that a files target is by default a directory of indexes ( 0 , 1 , etc.). This mean that you can add an entire folder of images (or whatever your data is) with a single update. Also, each link ( large , small , etc.) will always have the special meta and content sub-links, which correspond to the (usually encrypted) file metadata and content. Below is a JSON representation of file indexes from a single image corresponding to say, file 0 above. Example { \"links\" : { \"large\" : { \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"checksum\" : \"EqkWwbMQoSosYnu85XHpdTsM3NDKTRPk5j4RQjN6c4FZ\" , \"source\" : \"D4QdxGCAFnGwCHAQxrros1V6zEf78N4ugK3GwZyT5dTJ\" , \"opts\" : \"21uBAuSeQUdw5aDu5CYPxEfeiLVeuvku1T26nWtJC84C\" , \"hash\" : \"QmcvoHe333KRf3tfNKrtrM7aMUVnrB4b1JyzhSFybepvqQ\" , \"key\" : \"6cCnusZVHwp6udnKv3eYhurHK6ArJyFxCYRWTUFG8ZuMwSDwVbis9FUX3GRs\" , \"media\" : \"image/jpeg\" , \"name\" : \"clyde.jpg\" , \"size\" : \"84222\" , \"added\" : \"2019-03-17T01:20:17.061749Z\" , \"meta\" : { \"height\" : 600 , \"width\" : 800 }, \"targets\" : [ \"QmPngweFQ9VUhjtyy8nfJRZ8us9UFbS6Y2trwmAswfJ2yk\" ] }, \"small\" : { \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"checksum\" : \"7Gu5s6sZkwU8UQWwJNnJSrVY75ZkQG4bpQSwQPwkk8aX\" , \"source\" : \"D4QdxGCAFnGwCHAQxrros1V6zEf78N4ugK3GwZyT5dTJ\" , \"opts\" : \"CassDcqf192MnceweJKGJvhZfrV9kB3GJRbvNPWm6raa\" , \"hash\" : \"QmZuD522rQiFE2GdbNXvzcQ3Ci6aLvvJtWz52a97iEDy9G\" , \"key\" : \"29ce4pg64Lj78GuTauQDxeqpfdNCF7fNsJauS552wfpkEjegq8kQgwiNAzJQZ\" , \"media\" : \"image/jpeg\" , \"name\" : \"clyde.jpg\" , \"size\" : \"18145\" , \"added\" : \"2019-03-17T01:20:14.739531Z\" , \"meta\" : { \"height\" : 240 , \"width\" : 320 }, \"targets\" : [ \"QmPngweFQ9VUhjtyy8nfJRZ8us9UFbS6Y2trwmAswfJ2yk\" ] }, \"thumb\" : { \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"checksum\" : \"GzB1CWKkKQ5sWS8qQXDoBZxsfFgsgZwD9Z51qX5d7LGW\" , \"source\" : \"EqkWwbMQoSosYnu85XHpdTsM3NDKTRPk5j4RQjN6c4FZ\" , \"opts\" : \"7aGVJ7nGgmHdqv8oiEKZ2ZbrNBv1zVP3ADSuT2sW3MwT\" , \"hash\" : \"QmUuXPhrtLJUzfuoJu7BkfiB2mGfKwq4ExTTF8gVUvAh2U\" , \"key\" : \"KfW8nTEZqh1NbAcmB51DMaooe34ujucx2DMqBwiz4xs9sDVhNDYNPratgtbf\" , \"media\" : \"image/jpeg\" , \"name\" : \"clyde.jpg\" , \"size\" : \"2979\" , \"added\" : \"2019-03-17T01:20:17.133863Z\" , \"meta\" : { \"height\" : 75 , \"width\" : 100 }, \"targets\" : [ \"QmPngweFQ9VUhjtyy8nfJRZ8us9UFbS6Y2trwmAswfJ2yk\" ] } } } Schemas \u00b6 Schemas are used to create and validate the structure of thread files, defining their type and purpose for consumers (users and applications). For example, a photos application may create photo-based threads, a health application my create threads with medical records, etc. By treating schemas as first-class citizens, other applications are also able to understand and make use of these threads. In practice, schemas have three distinct roles: Provide instructions for how to transform or \"mill\" an input, e.g., given a photo, create three different sizes and discard the raw input (this is the media schema). Define whether or not the resulting DAG nodes should be stored (pinned) on account peers. Validate thread files from other participants, applying the same storage rules as in (2). The structure of a schema maps closely to the DAG nodes it creates (see below for examples). Highly complex nodes can be specified with dependencies between each link. A peer will automatically sort this 'graph' of dependencies (using topological sorting ) into a series of \"steps\". Each step is handled by a mill . For example, consider a thread backed by the builtin camera roll schema. The following steps must be taken to add a photo: The raw photo is sent to the blob mill (passthrough) and encrypted. The next two steps can be done in parallel. The output of (1) is stripped of EXIF data, resampled to a thumb nail size, and encrypted. EXIF data is extracted and encrypted from the output of (1). All of these output files (and their metadata) are added to IPFS in a single \"folder\" or DAG structure. Encryption \u00b6 Threads blocks and their links are always encrypted. However, file encryption is defined by schema nodes using the \"plaintext\" param and is on by default, i.e, \"plaintext\": true means \"do not encrypt this node\". The decrypting gateway can be used to decrypt files outside of a peer's API. Presets \u00b6 There are several \"preset\" or builtin schemas, available for use from client libraries. Textile Photos uses the media and camera roll presets. Media \u00b6 Used for posting media intended for sharing Example { \"name\" : \"media\" , \"pin\" : true , \"links\" : { \"large\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"800\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } }, \"small\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"320\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } }, \"thumb\" : { \"use\" : \"large\" , \"pin\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"100\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } } } } Camera Roll \u00b6 Used for backing up a mobile phone camera roll Example { \"name\" : \"camera_roll\" , \"pin\" : true , \"links\" : { \"raw\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"mill\" : \"/blob\" }, \"exif\" : { \"use\" : \"raw\" , \"mill\" : \"/image/exif\" }, \"thumb\" : { \"use\" : \"raw\" , \"pin\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"320\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } } } } Avatars \u00b6 Used by the internal account thread for user avatar images Example { \"name\" : \"avatar\" , \"pin\" : true , \"links\" : { \"large\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"pin\" : true , \"plaintext\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"320\" , \"quality\" : \"75\" } }, \"small\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"pin\" : true , \"plaintext\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"100\" , \"quality\" : \"75\" } } } } JSON Schemas \u00b6 JSON-based schemas are defined using the json_schema property: Example { \"pin\" : true , \"plaintext\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"json_schema\" : /* ... */ } Simply embed your JSON Schema within the thread schemas. Examples \u00b6 A \"Person\" \u00b6 The \"Person\" example from http://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples.html Example { \"pin\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"json_schema\" : { \"$id\" : \"https://example.com/person.schema.json\" , \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\" , \"title\" : \"Person\" , \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"firstName\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"The person's first name.\" }, \"lastName\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"The person's last name.\" }, \"age\" : { \"description\" : \"Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.\" , \"type\" : \"integer\" , \"minimum\" : 0 } } } } Logs \u00b6 BSD syslog protocol ( https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3164 ) Example { \"pin\" : true , \"plaintext\" : false , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"json_schema\" : { \"$ref\" : \"#/definitions/Log\" , \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\" , \"definitions\" : { \"Log\" : { \"additionalProperties\" : false , \"properties\" : { \"application\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"hostname\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"message\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" }, \"pid\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" }, \"priority\" : { \"type\" : \"integer\" }, \"timestamp\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" } }, \"required\" : [ \"priority\" , \"timestamp\" , \"hostname\" , \"application\" , \"pid\" , \"message\" ], \"type\" : \"object\" } } } } JSON Patch \u00b6 RFC 6902 A schema for tracking JSON document modifications can be built with the JSON Patch specification : JSON Patch defines a JSON document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document...

A FILES block points to the top-level hash of a file's DAG node. The structure of files DAG nodes are determined by, and validated against, a schema . A thread can have only one schema . It has two main functions: Define a Thread's data DAG structure Define the order of mills (transforms) needed to produce this structure from the input To illustrate these functions, take a look at the builtin media schema. Each link ( large , small , thumb ) produces a resized and encrypted image by leveraging the image/resize mill. Notice that the thumb link uses the large as input. This means that large will need to milled before thumb . Once you understand how schemas and mills work, you can design complex workflows and structures for your applications. In addition to the transformed bytes, a mill will produce a file metadata object for every input: message FileMeta { string mill = 1 ; // Mill used to process the file (e.g., `/image/resize`, `/json`) string checksum = 2 ; // Pre-milled (md5) checksum of the input file string source = 3 ; // Source file CID string opts = 4 ; // md5 checksum of input mill options string hash = 5 ; // CID hash of milled file string key = 6 ; // AES encryption key string media = 7 ; // Media type (e.g., `'application/json'`, `'image/jpeg'`) string name = 8 ; // Name of the input file int64 size = 9 ; // Size of the milled file in bytes google . protobuf . Timestamp added = 10 ; // Date the file was added to the thread google . protobuf . Struct meta = 11 ; // Additional metadata repeated string targets = 12 ; // DAG targets the file belongs to (kept only by the local peer) } File metadata objects are what most applications will interact with. They are the objects listed by the Files and Feed APIs. These objects are also used internally for various functions. For example, because good encryption is not deterministic, an input's checksum is used to de-duplicate encrypted data. At this point, it should be clear that adding data to a thread results in a DAG defined by a schema. But how exactly is the data stored so as to be programmatically accessible to thread consumers? Let's take a closer look at the DAG produced by the builtin media schema... A DAG node created by the built-in \"media\" schema. Note that a files target is by default a directory of indexes ( 0 , 1 , etc.). This mean that you can add an entire folder of images (or whatever your data is) with a single update. Also, each link ( large , small , etc.) will always have the special meta and content sub-links, which correspond to the (usually encrypted) file metadata and content. Below is a JSON representation of file indexes from a single image corresponding to say, file 0 above.

For example, a photos application may create photo-based threads, a health application my create threads with medical records, etc. By treating schemas as first-class citizens, other applications are also able to understand and make use of these threads. In practice, schemas have three distinct roles: Provide instructions for how to transform or \"mill\" an input, e.g., given a photo, create three different sizes and discard the raw input (this is the media schema). Define whether or not the resulting DAG nodes should be stored (pinned) on account peers. Validate thread files from other participants, applying the same storage rules as in (2). The structure of a schema maps closely to the DAG nodes it creates (see below for examples). Highly complex nodes can be specified with dependencies between each link. A peer will automatically sort this 'graph' of dependencies (using topological sorting ) into a series of \"steps\". Each step is handled by a mill . For example, consider a thread backed by the builtin camera roll schema. The following steps must be taken to add a photo: The raw photo is sent to the blob mill (passthrough) and encrypted. The next two steps can be done in parallel. The output of (1) is stripped of EXIF data, resampled to a thumb nail size, and encrypted. EXIF data is extracted and encrypted from the output of (1).

Textile remains flexible enough for your application to write or read any document your user wants to store. Below, we walk through how to think about each of these cases generally. Then we show an example of building on the popular note storage schema used Slate and all the note-taking apps that use it. Get Started \u00b6 Document connectors are use-case specific. However, there are many cases where applications want to store PDFs or other formats for their users. These often fall into specific connectors (e.g., purchasing or receipts for PDFs). Let's look quickly at how you can leverage Textile to connect to one of the popular notes formats used by many apps. We are going to jump right in, so if any of the below does not sound familiar, be sure to read over the Tour of Textile . The Slate Notes Schema \u00b6 We are focusing on the note storage schema used by Slate. The schema is simply this, { \"document\" : Object , \"blocks\" : Object , \"inlines\" : Object , \"rules\" : Array , } And so may result in a document that looks more like this, { \"document\" : { \"nodes\" : [ { \"match\" : { \"type\" : \"paragraph\" } } ] }, \"blocks\" : { \"list\" : { \"nodes\" : [{ \"match\" : { \"type\" : \"item\" } }] }, \"item\" : { \"parent\" : { \"type\" : \"list\" } } }, \"inlines\" : { \"emoji\" : { \"isVoid\" : true , \"nodes\" : [{ \"match\" : { \"object\" : \"text\" } }] } } } Any application using the Slate library is already using a variant of the schema shown above and so can store a user's notes (or other documents) in a way that other apps can make use of them (new UI, collaborative interfaces, etc.). Slate thread schema \u00b6 The first thing we need to do is take the above Slate schema for documents and format it as a Textile JSON schema. Here is what that looks like, with each of the primary elements in the Slate document defined as properties of the JSON object. { \"name\" : \"slatejs\" , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"plaintext\" : true , \"pin\" : true , \"json_schema\" : { \"$id\" : \"https://example.com/slatejs.schema.json\" , \"$schema\" : \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\" , \"title\" : \"Hash Optimized Slate.js Schema\" , \"description\" : \"Slate.js Schema Files.\" , \"required\" : [], \"type\" : \"object\" , \"properties\" : { \"document\" : { \"type\" : \"object\" }, \"blocks\" : { \"type\" : \"object\" }, \"inlines\" : { \"type\" : \"object\" }, \"rules\" : { \"type\" : \"array\" } } } } We can save that JSON file as slate.json to use for creating a thread below. Create a Slate thread \u00b6 You can now use the above schema to quickly create Textile threads that are interoperable with other apps using the Slate library for document editing. Here's how we create our app's new thread. cmd textile threads add \"app notes\" --schema-file=slate.json --type=\"public\" --sharing=\"invite_only\" JS HTTP const schema = require ( 'slate.json' ) await textile . threads . add ( \"app notes\" , JSON . stringify ( schema ), \"your.bundle.id.version.Notes\" , \"public\" , \"invite_only\" ) React Native const schema = require ( 'slate.json' ); const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.Notes' const threadName = 'app notes' const schema = { id : '' , json : JSON . stringify ( schema ), preset : AddThreadConfig .

The Textile SDKs and game connectors allow developers to create new real-world and digital experiences using the IPFS network, Textile user profiles, shared databases, and secure communications. Get Started \u00b6 To demonstrate some of the capabilities of the Textile SDK for game development, we've provided a decentralized game example, IPFS Tag. IPFS Tag uses Textile to allow a group of in-person users to create and join a real-world game of tag. Textile allows each participant to create an identity, join the game, chat, see current game state, and play. IPFS Tag was implemented using Textile's React Native SDK, and we've also created a live workshop that uses only shell and the Textile Daemon (no mobile components needed). Here, we'll walk through each of the data connectors used to build the game, focusing on the mobile variant. In-game profiles \u00b6 IPFS Tag keeps profiles light-weight, only requiring a display name for each user. To create a profile, the game uses the Textile Account tools, just like Textile Photos and other apps, but skips selection, since the game won't be displaying those images. Textile Profile cmd textile profile set --name=\"Clyde\" JavaScript await textile . profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" ) React Native await textile . profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" ) Objective-C NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . profile setName : @\"Clyde\" error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? Textile . instance (). profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android Textile . instance (). profile . setName ( \"Clyde\" ); Success ok Textile profiles come configured with cryptographic identity and verification tools. This means that an app can quickly verify that a user is who they claim to be and that user genuinely created any transaction. This helps verify the source of new activities and ensuring all players are playing by the rules of your game! Avatars \u00b6 Avatars are a must in so many games. Using the Textile profile APIs, your app can easily help users change their usernames and avatars and update the rest of the gamers with that data. cmd textile profile set --avatar=\"path/to/an/image\" JavaScript const form = new FormData () form . append ( 'file' , file , file . name ) // file is File object or raw Buffer/Blob await textile . profile . setAvatar ( form ) React Native @ todo Objective-C @ todo Swift @ todo Android @todo Success ok Global contact index \u00b6 Help your users find one-another by leveraging Textile's decentralized search index of contacts. cmd textile contacts search --name=\"Andrew\" JavaScript // The js-http-client returns a `ReadableStream` to be accessed by the caller // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream for details const stream = await textile . contacts . search ( \"Andrew\" ) React Native @ todo Objective-C NSError * error ; QueryOptions * options = [[ QueryOptions alloc ] init ]; options . wait = 10 ; options . limit = 1 ; ContactQuery * query = [[ ContactQuery alloc ] init ]; query . name = @\"Andrew\" ; MobileSearchHandle * handle = [ Textile . instance . contacts search : query options : options error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ? let options = QueryOptions () options . wait = 10 options . limit = 1 let query = ContactQuery () query . name = \"Andrew\" let handle = Textile . instance (). contacts . search ( query , options : options , error : & error ) if ( error != nil ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Android QueryOptions options = QueryOptions . newBuilder () . setWait ( 10 ) . setLimit ( 1 ) . build (); ContactQuery query = ContactQuery . newBuilder () . setName ( \"Andrew\" ) . build (); SearchHandle handle = Textile . instance (). contacts . search ( query , options ); Success { \"id\" : \"P8FxdgZ1rWxaQ4DrmMBADuYTz4XGpQeThJYxfL2X4WN89hP8\" , \"date\" : \"2019-04-12T21:41:28.071460350Z\" , \"value\" : { \"@type\" : \"/Contact\" , \"address\" : \"P8FxdgZ1rWxaQ4DrmMBADuYTz4XGpQeThJYxfL2X4WN89hP8\" , \"name\" : \"devandrewwww\" , \"avatar\" : \"QmQwmPninpCRdkAhbPwKaf7hAUwkTb2wiwupcgnsMp5yW5\" , \"peers\" : [ /* ... */ ] } } { \"id\" : \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , \"date\" : \"2019-02-08T02:59:35.082729740Z\" , \"value\" : { \"@type\" : \"/Contact\" , \"address\" : \"P8rW2RCMn75Dcb96Eiyg8mirb8nL4ruCumvJxKZRfAdpE5fG\" , \"name\" : \"andrew knees and toes, knees and toes\" , \"avatar\" : \"QmRLnTHdvg4rAh1AKJaHydAZ42sgygLNdvvA7aMwaRY5SK\" , \"peers\" : [ /* ... */ ] } } /* ... */ User authentication \u00b6 Textile doesn't force you to use any single authentication system, we encourage you to use what's best for your app. The Textile libraries and data wallet are meant to work well with any user-management system you need to use. The sky is the limit! Game state sync \u00b6 Next, a user will need to create a game, and the state of that game will need to be synchronized between all players. This is handled by a game thread that is generated just for this game. In the demo app, we kept thread configurations minimal, allowing any number of users to be added to the thread later. However, in your game, you may also want to take advantage of read-only permissions for cases where the game creator will be the only one sending game updates to users, or whitelists when all possible members of the thread are known at creation time. Globally shared app state in a game of tag Info Read our in-depth documentation on threads and how to create them. Also, follow along with our threads v2 roadmap to learn about what they will be able to do next. Create a new database \u00b6 A game can have any number of threads to be used by players. Each thread can customize properties such as who can read or write, any data that shouldn't be encrypted, who can join, and who can invite new members to the database (to read or write accordingly). For example, to create the game of tag, each new game becomes a new thread that is kept for the duration of the game and any subsequent rematches. In the game of tag, any user can invite new users at any time. cmd textile threads add \"app notes\" --schema-file=tag_game.json --type=\"public\" --sharing=\"invite_only\" JS HTTP const schema = require ( 'tag_game.json' ) await textile . threads . add ( \"app notes\" , JSON . stringify ( schema ), \"your.bundle.id.version.Tag\" , \"public\" , \"invite_only\" ) React Native const schema = require ( 'tag_game.json' ); const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.Tag' const threadName = 'game-of-tag' const schema = { id : '' , json : JSON . stringify ( schema ), preset : AddThreadConfig .

Those included Game Start with Duration, Tag Events, and Rematch Requests. Here's what that basic schema looks like, Schemas \u00b6 Schemas allow you to define the data model of each thread. By restricting what types or structure of data your app will write, you can ensure everyone is playing by the same set of rules! Here's what the schema looks like for a simple game of tag. const tagSchema = { \"name\" : \"cmd-line-tag\" , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"json_schema\" : { \"title\" : \"CMD Line Tag Mechanics\" , \"description\" : \"Possible events in cmd line tag.\" , \"type\" : \"object\" , \"required\" : [ \"event\" ], \"properties\" : { \"event\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"event type identifier, either tag or start\" }, \"target\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"peer-id of the person getting tagged\" }, \"source\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"peer-id of the person doing the tagging\" }, \"duration\" : { \"type\" : \"number\" , \"description\" : \"game duration, required by start events\" } } } } App-based rules and validation \u00b6 The data schemas and rules about who can read or write data will only go so far for game development, but there is no limit to how you combine them with in-game rule systems. Additionally, you can combine your own rule systems with the cryptographic validation methods available through Textile. Let's take a look at how we've done this in our example game of tag. In our game of tag, the actual tagging event happens as a new entry in the database. The app itself ensures that the only person that can write a tag event is the person getting tagged. That can be validated by their cryptographic signature. Using the schema above, we can encode a rule in JavaScript as follows, where we easily ignore any falsified entries in our thread. if ( row . event === 'tag' && row . source === row . user . address && actor === row . target ) { const tagger : IContact = await Textile . contacts . get ( row . source ) const tagged : IContact = await Textile . contacts . get ( row . target ) console . log ({ tagger : tagger , tagged : tagged , timestamp : file . date . seconds }) } Thread limits \u00b6 Apps aren't limited to a set number of threads. Developers can easily create ephemeral threads, private app threads, and long-term threads for their users. Content distribution \u00b6 Levels & assets \u00b6 Threads also provide a tool to distribute new game content to users. This can be done by creating read-only Threads owned by the app developer and shared to every new game installation. Here is an example of a thread schema designed to allow the developer to distribute content to all the existing subscribers securely. const tagSchema = { \"name\" : \"app-thread\" , \"mill\" : \"/json\" , \"json_schema\" : { \"title\" : \"Levels\" , \"description\" : \"In-app content distribution for new levels.\" , \"type\" : \"object\" , \"required\" : [ \"event\" ], \"properties\" : { \"version\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"A version ID.\" }, \"title\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"Content title.\" }, \"address\" : { \"type\" : \"string\" , \"description\" : \"IPFS address of data.\" } } } } Leader boards \u00b6 Similarly, developers can embed global feeds such as leaderboards, where all members of the game can follow (but not modify) information such as leaders, scores, or achievements. In-game chat \u00b6 Many games rely on good group-based chat directly available within the game environment. In Textile, every thread you create can host a light-weight, end-to-end encrypted chat among participants with write capabilities. This means you can create chat rooms for small subsets of players or larger groups of players that can enter and leave a channel at any time. IPFS Tag includes a private chat in every game Once a user has been added to a thread, transmitting a chat based message to other members is simple. cmd textile messages add <thread-id> \"hello?\" JavaScript await textile . messages . add ( \"<thread-id>\" , \"hello?\" ) React Native await textile . messages . add ( \"<thread-id>\" , \"hello?\" ) Objective-C NSError * error ; [ Textile . instance . messages add : @\"<thread-id>\" body : @\"hello?\" error : & error ]; if ( error ) { // Do something with this error } else { // Success! } Swift var error : NSError ?

In our game of tag, the actual tagging event happens as a new entry in the database. The app itself ensures that the only person that can write a tag event is the person getting tagged. That can be validated by their cryptographic signature. Using the schema above, we can encode a rule in JavaScript as follows, where we easily ignore any falsified entries in our thread. if ( row . event === 'tag' && row . source === row . user . address && actor === row . target ) { const tagger : IContact = await Textile . contacts . get ( row . source ) const tagged : IContact = await Textile . contacts . get ( row . target ) console . log ({ tagger : tagger , tagged : tagged , timestamp : file . date . seconds }) }","title":"App-based rules and validation"},{"location":"connectors/games/#thread-limits","text":"Apps aren't limited to a set number of threads.

The Textile image & media connector is an excellent place for you to start. Textile has already designed a robust system for user photo storage and recovery, and all your app needs to do is plug into it. Get Started \u00b6 Handling images for your users falls generally into two use-cases. First, images need to be store in full-resolution form, typically useful for backup & recovery or editing apps. Second, images need to be formatted for efficient distribution to other users or on the web. Here, we'll walk through setting up each use-case in your app. Images & media threads \u00b6 Threads help a user grant access to their photos & media to new applications, share individual photos to new users, or sync all their data to trusted peers like their desktop or store it encrypted on the cafes. We covered threads in depth in the Tour of Textile and in the Threads Introduction pages. We recommend reviewing those two documents if you haven't already. Let's look apps can create new image-based threads in their app or connect to existing ones the user is already maintaining in other apps. Create new photo threads \u00b6 Full resolution images \u00b6 To handle full-res images, your app can connect to existing user threads (such as those created in Textile Photos) or create new ones. Every Textile peer already knows how to create and talk to Threads of this type. Here is how you would create one of these threads in your app. cmd textile threads add \"New Shots\" --key=\"your.bundle.id.version.CameraRoll\" --cameraRoll JS HTTP const thread = await textile . threads . add ( \"New Shots\" , 'cameraRoll' ) React Native const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.CameraRoll' const threadName = 'Dogs' const schema = { id : '' , json : '' , preset : AddThreadConfig .

OPEN ) . setSharing ( Thread . Sharing . SHARED ) . setSchema ( schema ) . build (); Textile . instance (). threads . add ( config ); The app posting new photos to this thread doesn't need to handle sampling raw images proactively, instead, the Textile peer has the file milling logic to transform any input image into the output schema. Here's what the schema looks like, { \"name\" : \"camera_roll\" , \"pin\" : true , \"links\" : { \"raw\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"mill\" : \"/blob\" }, \"exif\" : { \"use\" : \"raw\" , \"mill\" : \"/image/exif\" }, \"thumb\" : { \"use\" : \"raw\" , \"pin\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"320\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } } } } Here are the major ideas of the schema and how to think about them in your app. Input photos will be transformed into 3 files: Raw, EXIF metadata, and thumbnail. Thumbnails will be pinned locally for fast lookup. Raw files will keep the input resolution. Thumbnails will be max 320px wide and have JPEG quality reduction to save storage space. Sharable images \u00b6 Sharable image threads are optimized for p2p or group sharing of content. Every Textile peer contains a schema (and mill) for handling these kinds of threads, simply named, media . You can create a new media thread as follows. cmd textile threads add \"New Shares\" --media JS HTTP const thread = await textile . threads . add ( \"New Shares\" , 'media' ) React Native const threadKey = 'your.bundle.id.version.Media' const threadName = 'Dogs' const schema = { id : '' , json : '' , preset : AddThreadConfig .

OPEN ) . setSharing ( Thread . Sharing . SHARED ) . setSchema ( schema ) . build (); Textile . instance (). threads . add ( config ); Like the CameraRoll thread types, Media thread types contain a local file mill that will resample any input image to make it share-ready. Here is what the thread's schema looks like. { \"name\" : \"media\" , \"pin\" : true , \"links\" : { \"large\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"800\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } }, \"small\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"320\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } }, \"thumb\" : { \"use\" : \"large\" , \"pin\" : true , \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"width\" : \"100\" , \"quality\" : \"80\" } } } } Unlike the CameraRoll schema, you can see that images are resampled into a few different variants but the original, full-resolution file is not maintained. You may also notice that the small format of a Media thread is the same format as the thumbnail in the CameraRoll thread. This can be helpful if you add a photo to multiple threads, as there is the opportunity to deduplicate this content. Connect to existing photo threads \u00b6 In many cases, it is just as easy for your app to connect to a user's existing photo threads. Connecting to an existing stream can give your app the ability to provide value across many more photos or simplify photo selection, editing, or sharing workflows. Requesting permission to a user's existing Media or CameraRoll threads is straightforward in your app and is expected to be released to production in the first half of July. Subscribe to this Issue to track our progress on the feature. Beyond improving the experience in your app, leveraging existing user threads can help reduce the overall data you or your users are required to store. IPFS based content addressing allows photos to be shared across all of a user's apps without the need to ever duplicate that content. Created unencrypted content \u00b6 There are some use-cases where media created by a user is best shared in a decrypted format. Every Textile thread supports encrypted raw file content by default, but apps have the ability to create encrypted threads that contain plaintext file content. Read more about thread encryption here . Cafe Sync & Recovery \u00b6 A critical component of the image & media connector is the ability for your users to recover their data in the future. Threads can be easily backed up by registering your app with a live cafe or by encouraging your users to manage their cafe subscriptions.

For example, to allow CORS from all origins: Example textile config API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '[\"*\"]' Account \u00b6 // Account store public account info type Account struct { Address string // public key (seed is stored in the _possibly_ encrypted datastore) Thread string // thread id of the default account thread used for sync between account peers } Account.Address \u00b6 Address is the account-wide public key derived from a wallet account seed. Default : Populated upon repository initialization Account.Thread \u00b6 Thread is currently a libp2p peer ID derived from the account seed. This will be changed to the hash of a symmetric key in the next version of threads. Default : Populated upon repository initialization Addresses \u00b6 // Addresses stores the (string) bind addresses for the node. type Addresses struct { API string // bind address of the local REST API CafeAPI string // bind address of the cafe REST API Gateway string // bind address of the IPFS object gateway Profiling string // bind address of the profiling API } Addresses.API \u00b6 This API is used to control the daemon through the command line (or via curl or some other client). Unlike the Gateway address, you should ensure that the API address is not dial-able from outside of your machine, or potentially malicious parties may be able to send commands to your daemon. Having said that, see the API config entry for details on further controlling the API HTTP server. Default : \"127.0.0.1:40600\" Addresses.CafeAPI \u00b6 Normally, only a designated cafe peer would enable this API, though any peer may operate as a cafe if desired. See the cafes overview for more. Default : \"127.0.0.1:40601\" Addresses.Gateway \u00b6 The gateway may be used to view and decrypt files. This port may or may not be dial-able from outside you machine, that's entirely up to you. The Gateway address is on by default, but if you leave it blank, the gateway server will not start. Default : \"127.0.0.1:5050\" Addresses.Profiling \u00b6 This API is used internally for obtaining memory and CPU profiles from a running peer. Default : \"127.0.0.1:6060\" API \u00b6 // API settings type API struct { HTTPHeaders map [ string ][] string // HTTP headers to return with the API. SizeLimit int64 // Maximum file size limit to accept for POST requests in bytes (a zero value means no limit) } API.HTTPHeaders \u00b6 A map of HTTP headers for responses from the API. You might want to edit these settings if you need to allow additional access control methods, or require authorization headers , etc. For example, you may want to enable CORS for your API; this can be done by modifying your \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header. See this blog post for a discussion of similar IPFS gateway settings.

A zero value indicates no limit should be enforced. Default : 0 Logs \u00b6 // Logs settings type Logs struct { LogToDisk bool // when true, sends all logs to rolling files on disk } Logs.LogToDisk \u00b6 A boolean indicating whether to send all logs to rolling files on disk (true) or Stdout (false). Logs written to disk ( <repo-dir>/logs/textile.log ) can be monitored via tail -f <repo-dir>/logs/textile.log or similar. The verbosity of these logs can be controlled at run-time via the logs command (see textile logs --help for details).

Default : false Cafe \u00b6 type Cafe struct { Host CafeHost Client CafeClient } For more information about configuring and running a cafe peer, see the daemon installation guide . The Cafe config entry is broken up into two sections, one for controlling how a cafe Host behaves, and one for controlling how a Client interacts with a host peer. Cafe.CafeHost \u00b6 type CafeHost struct { Open bool // When true, other peers can register with this node for cafe services. URL string // Override the resolved URL of this cafe, useful for load HTTPS and/or load balancers NeighborURL string // Specifies the URL of a secondary cafe. Must return cafe info. SizeLimit int64 // Maximum file size limit to accept for POST requests in bytes. } Cafe.CafeHost.Open \u00b6 A boolean indicating whether or not to open the Cafe API and accept client requests. Default : false Cafe.CafeHost.URL \u00b6 Override this value if a cafe peer is behind a DNS-based load balancer and/or requires HTTPS. For example, Textile's federated cafes run behind EC2 load balancers with HTTPS listeners, which route traffic to the cafe API bind address. If not specified during repository initialization, a peer will try to determine its \"most public\" IP address on start up: Use a LAN address if present in the peer host's advertised addresses If no LAN is present, poll the peer host for an address that passes a superficial test for being public (it may take a few seconds to to complete NAT discovery) Use the loopback address ( 127.0.0.1 ) Default : http://<SWARM_IP>:40601 Cafe.CafeHost.NeighborURL \u00b6 Deprecated .

Apps running the Android SDK run an on device Textile peer (including a managed IPFS peer). The SDK provides you with a number of helpful APIs to manage sharing, contacts, file encryption & storage, and much more. Below are some basic examples to get you started. If you are interested in a more thorough walk-through, check out the Tour of Textile's examples using Java or jump to the full API documentation if you are ready. Installation \u00b6 The Textile Android library is published in Textile's Bintray Maven repository . The library source is published on GitHub . Gradle \u00b6 First, you'll need to add Textile's Bintray Maven repository to you project's top level build.gradle in the allProjects.repositories section: allprojects { repositories { ... maven { url \"https://dl.bintray.com/textile/maven\" } ... } } Next, add the Textile dependency to your app module's build.gradle dependencies section, specifying the latest version available : dependencies { ... implementation 'io.textile:textile:0.1.20' ... } Getting Started \u00b6 Initialize Textile \u00b6 Then, in your application\u2019s MainActivity.java , setup Textile as follows, String recoveryPhrase = Textile . initialize ( this . getApplicationContext (), false , false ); if ( recoveryPhrase != nil ) { // Return phrase to the user for secure, out of app, storage } class MyEventListener extends BaseTextileEventListener { // ... } Textile . instance (). addEventListener ( new MyEventListener ()); By default, the Textile instance will manage itself during app life-cycle events as long as you initialize it correctly in your app, meaning your app will be connected to the IPFS network whenever your app requires it. Get the account display name \u00b6 Android String name = Textile . instance (). profile . name (); Subscribe to file updates \u00b6 Android // Add an event listener that conforms to TextileEventListener class MyEventListener extends BaseTextileEventListener { @Override public void threadUpdateReceived ( io . textile . pb . View . FeedItem feedItem ) { if ( feedItem . getPayload (). getTypeUrl () == \"/Files\" ) { // new file! } } } Textile . instance (). addEventListener ( new MyEventListener ()); Fetch chronological thread updates \u00b6 Android FeedRequest request = FeedRequest . newBuilder () . setThread ( \"<thread-id>\" ) . build (); FeedItemList feedItemList = Textile . instance (). feed . list ( request ); Create a thread \u00b6 Android AddThreadConfig . Schema schema = AddThreadConfig . Schema . newBuilder () . setPreset ( AddThreadConfig . Schema . Preset . BLOB ) . build (); AddThreadConfig config = AddThreadConfig . newBuilder () . setKey ( \"your.bundle.id.version.Basic\" ) . setName ( \"Basic\" ) . setType ( Thread . Type . PRIVATE ) . setSharing ( Thread . Sharing . NOT_SHARED ) . setSchema ( schema ) . build (); Textile . instance (). threads . add ( config ); Add a file \u00b6 Android final String threadId = \"<thread-id>\" ; byte [] jsonData = \"{ latitude: 48.858093, longitude: 2.294694 }\" . getBytes (); String dataString = Base64 . encodeToString ( jsonData , Base64 .

Android final String threadId = \"<thread-id>\" ; String filePath = \"/path/to/mmm-bytes....\" ; Textile . instance (). files . prepareByPath ( filePath , threadId , new PreparedFilesHandler () { @Override public void onFilesPrepared ( MobilePreparedFiles preparedFiles ) { try { Textile . instance (). files . add ( preparedFiles . getDir (), threadId , null ); } catch ( Exception e ) { // Do something with this error } } @Override public void onError ( Exception e ) { // Do something with this error } }); Get a file \u00b6 Android String hash = \"some file hash\" ; String base64 = Textile . instance (). files . data ( hash ); Example application \u00b6 The android-textile repo contains a simple code example you may find useful in your exploration. API Documentation \u00b6 The full API documentation for Textile's Android SDK (android-textile) can be found at https://textileio.github.io/android-textile .

Apps running the iOS SDK run an on device Textile peer (including a managed IPFS peer). The SDK provides you with a number of helpful APIs to manage sharing, contacts, file encryption & storage, and much more. Below are some basic examples to get you started. If you are interested in a more thorough walk-through, check out the Tour of Textile's examples using Swift or Objective-C or jump to the full API documentation if you are ready. Installation \u00b6 The iOS is published as a pod on CocoaPod.org . The library is also published on GitHub . CocoaPods \u00b6 If you haven't already, you'll need to setup CocoaPods in your project . Next, add Textile to your project. pod 'Textile' This will install the latest version of the SDK into your app. Carthage (experimental) \u00b6 Carthage support is minimally tested today, but if you are a Carthage user and would like to try, we'd love a PR here to update this process. github \"textileio/ios-textile\" There you'll need two dependencies that are the Protobuf library from Google and the Textile Core iOS library available on our releases page . You can see how those are handled in our CocoaPods setup . Getting Started \u00b6 Initialize Textile \u00b6 Objective-C \u00b6 Then in your application delegate\u2019s - application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: method, setup Textile as follows, // Early on in the app lifecycle, usually in AppDelegate // Initialize a new Textile wallet for the user.

To use the JS HTTP Client, you'll need either a locally running Daemon or a locally running Desktop Tray instance containing a Textile account and available on localhost with default ports for both the API and Gateway . Installation \u00b6 The JS HTTP Client is published as an NPM Package . You are free to use the source code directly or use a package manager to install the official release. NPM \u00b6 npm install @ textile / js - http - client Yarn \u00b6 yarn add @ textile / js - http - client TypeScript \u00b6 We strongly recommend using TypeScript if you plan to use the JS Client in your project. The JS Client's endpoints are all typed and those types are available to projects that support them. Because Textile libraries are rapidly developing, this will make your upgrade process much easier and faster. If you don't normally use TypeScript in your projects, never fear, it will be very familiar and only takes a few steps to setup. Tip We recommend TypeScript in 5 minutes as a good place to start if you are totally new to TypeScript. Getting Started \u00b6 Initialize the JS Client \u00b6 The JS HTTP Client does not maintain any state for your app, it simply provides easy to use APIs so your app can interact with your user's Textile account. You import the library in any library simply. // No initialization needed, only import import textile from \"@textile/js-http-client\" Below are some basic examples to get you started. If you are interested in a more thorough walk-through, check out the Tour of Textile's examples using the JS HTTP Client. Get the account display name \u00b6 const name = await textile . profile . name () Subscribe to file updates \u00b6 // The js-http-client returns a `ReadableStream` to be accessed by the caller // See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream for details const stream = await textile . subscribe . stream ( \"files\" ) const reader = stream . getReader () const read = ( result ) => { // ReadableStreamReadResult<FeedItem> if ( result . done ) { return } try { console . log ( result . value ) } catch ( err ) { reader . cancel ( undefined ) return } read ( await reader . read ()) } read ( await reader . read ()) Fetch chronological thread updates \u00b6 await textile . feed . list ( \"<thread-id>\" ) Create a thread \u00b6 const thread = await textile . threads . add ( \"Basic\" ) Add a file \u00b6 await textile . files . add ({ latitude : 48.858093 , longitude : 2.294694 }, \"\" , \"<thread-id>\" ) Files stored as blobs \u00b6 For threads you create that use the /blob schema, you need to add your files slightly differently if your code is running in Node.js or running in the browser. browser const data = new Blob ([ \"mmm, bytes...\" ]) await textile . files . add ( data , \"\" , \"<thread-id>\" ) node.js const block = await textile . files . add ( \"mmm, bytes...\" , \"\" , \"<thread-id>\" ) Get a file \u00b6 In this example, we get a file stored with a /json based schema. // fileHash is a string hash, commonly found in block.files[index].file.hash const jsonData = textile . file . content ( fileHash ) Files stored as blobs \u00b6 The same as when writing blob data to threads, you need to be aware of differences when reading blob data if you are in the browser versus if you are in Node.js. browser // fileHash is a string hash, commonly found in block.files[index].file.hash const content = textile . file . content ( fileHash ) const reader = new FileReader (); reader . onload = function () { console . log ( reader . result ); } reader . readAsText ( content ); node.js // fileHash is a string hash, commonly found in block.files[index].file.hash const content = textile . file . content ( fileHash ) Use with redux-saga \u00b6 Many clients are using libraries such as redux-sagas to manage app state combined with Textile.

Tip We recommend TypeScript in 5 minutes as a good place to start if you are totally new to TypeScript. Getting Started \u00b6 Initializing the Textile Wallet \u00b6 To start using the mobile Textile peer your app needs to initialize the local wallet. A wallet can be generated from scratch or you can allow the user to pair your app with their existing Textile account. We recommend that you only support pairing, but we'll show you both methods so you can experiment with the right setup on your own. Creating wallet from scratch \u00b6 Warning Mobile apps that use the React Native SDK (or one of our native libraries) run on-device Textile peers for their users. On-device peers require that the users pair the app with their primary account (see the Tour of Textile ). We recomment encouraging your users to pair with an external account during onboarding, as migrating their primary wallet out of an app later will be challenging (and is not supported yet!). // This is the user's new Textile wallet seed. They must keep it secure and never share it. Your production app should not keep a copy long term and should never share it with any API. const seed = await textile . initialize ( false , false ) alert ( `WARNING - Never lose or share your seed: ${ seed } ` ) Initialize with a paired account \u00b6 @ todo Once a local account is paired, you don't need to pass the pairing key on every startup.

Textile provides a \"tray\" (or taskbar) application, which can manage one or more account peers for your laptop or desktop. Using a client library , other desktop or web applications can be quickly built on top of the running peer's localhost HTTP API. The tray will soon ship with Photos Desktop pre-installed, as the first \"app\". Please contact us if you'd like to learn more about developing against Textile Desktop. Tip The tray can be paired with your other account peers running on your other devices. After the initial pairing, your threads will auto-magically stay in sync.

Click it to reveal the tray's UI. Existing accounts will appear in the dropdown menu. Click \"New\" to initialize a new account. Textile uses a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet to derive account keys from a set of unique words, called a mnemonic phrase . Read more about the wallet here . Every key \"inside\" an HD wallet can be derived from this mnemonic phrase. Effectively, the wallet is the mnemonic phrase. So, by clicking \"Create\" on this screen, you are creating an entirely new and unique wallet. By default, the tray app will use the first account key in the wallet to initialize an account peer. However, a wallet can derive an infinite number of account keys. You can optionally add a password that will be required along with your mnemonic phrase when accessing the wallet's account keys. If supplied, this same password will be used to encrypt the account peer's datastore at rest . The datastore will not be encrypted if the password field is left blank. The \"Refresh\" button simply re-generates the wallet. You can do this as many times as you like. Once you're signed into an account, set a global avatar and display name for your peer. You can click \"Threads\" to preview the datasets accessible by your peer. The \"Sync\" button searches for and syncs with other peers that share your account key. Lastly, registering your peer with an always-online cafe is highly recommended. See this section of the tour for details. Click \"Messages\" to manually query your cafe(s) for new messages that may have been received from others when your peer was offline or otherwise unreachable.

Info A daemon is a program that operates as a long-running 'background' process (without a terminal or user interface).

Initialize a cafe peer \u00b6 Anyone can run a cafe peer and offer services to the network. You do not need to rely on Textile's cafe network, or anyone else's network for that matter! Cafe peers are initialized by adding some additional flags to textile init : textile init &lt;account-seed&gt; --server --cafe-open --server : This flag applies the IPFS server profile and is highly recommended for cafe peers. --cafe-open : This flag \"opens\" the cafe, meaning that it will expose an additional \"service\" API over libp2p and HTTP. --cafe-url : Optional, http://<SWARM_IP>:40601 by default. Set this value if your peer is behind a DNS-based load balancer and/or requires HTTPS. For example, Textile's federated cafes run behind EC2 load balancers with HTTPS listeners, which route traffic to the cafe API port ( --cafe-bind-addr ). See Cafe.CafeHost.URL for details on how the default value of SWARM_IP is determined. Info Cafe service clients are issued JWT sessions used for authentication. These sessions contain the public URL of the cafe peer's service API so that it can be leveraged over HTTP.

We cannot decrypt or otherwise access the data you privately store or share with your contacts. You can choose to share your data such as photos in public forums whereby anyone can view the data contents. Textile provides remote data storage for users on the IPFS network (see https://ipfs.io/ ). The IPFS protocol has no mechanisms for deletion of data once added, so instead, we allow users to 'revoke' their data, such that all servers in the IPFS network run through Textile (including those in the mobile app) will discontinue the hosting and displaying of said data. When you share photos in group forums (\"Threads\"), the encryption keys for the data (full resolution photo, lower resolution copies, and basic metadata) are shared with Thread members and are visible to anyone with the keys to that Thread. Keys are distributed whenever you, or another Thread member, invite new members to the Thread. The encrypted data shared in Threads are distributed over a network of voluntary IPFS servers that no single member, or the Textile organization, controls. Read more about public-key cryptography and the IPFS protocol if you are interested in how this works. Information We Have \u00b6 Certain information (e.g. a user identifier, group identifiers, encrypted data, etc.) is transmitted to us solely for the purpose of transmitting messages. Unless otherwise stated below, this information is only kept as long as necessary to place each call or transmit each message, and is not used for any other purpose. Information we store The identifier you register with. The email contact address of any new user you invite to the network. Encrypted contents of Threads may be cached or hosted on voluntary IPFS hosts. By opt-in, you may request Textile to manage the hosting of your encrypted data on remote IPFS peers. Textile will store and mange the encrypted data, plus an index to each entry you create in order to provide an account quota. By opt-in, you may request Textile to maintain an encrypted copy of your private wallet, including your private data index. Your private wallet includes metadata about photos in your account, Threads you participate in, and Contacts you have. If a user decides to opt-in, only a privately encrypted copy of the wallet will be stored by Textile, all contents will only be readable by the user with access to their private keys. Transient information IP addresses may be kept for up to 90 days for rate limiting and to prevent abuse.

Please read these terms of service (these \u201c Terms \u201d) carefully as they form a contract between you and We Are Set, Inc, a Delaware corporation ( Textile , \u201c we \u201d, \u201c us \u201d, or \u201c our \u201d), that governs your access and use of (i) the web verification and encryption solution software provided by Textile (the \u201c Software \u201d); (ii) the Textile websites at textile.io and textile.photos (the \u201c Site \u201d); and (iii) any written or electronic use or features guides or other documentation provided or made available by Textile (the \u201c User Guides \u201d) (collectively the \u201c Service(s) \u201d). By registering or using any of the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising to Textile that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, \u201cyou\u201d and \u201cyour\u201d will refer to that organization). You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and only if you have the power to form a contract with Textile and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, YOU MUST NOT USE THE SERVICES . Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, please contact privacy@textile.io . Please note that Textile does not provide warranties for the Services. This contract also limits our liability to you and contains an arbitration provision and a class action waiver. See Sections 14 (NO WARRANTY), 16 (LIMITATION OF LIABILITY) and 19 (ARBITRATION) of these Terms for details. 1. ABOUT THE SERVICE \u00b6 The Service offers verification and authentication services and encryption services for users of photos and other personally collected data. The Service provides a private data storage system (\" Storage \") for users to maintain remote copies of their privately encrypted data. Storage is managed on IPFS ( https://www.ipfs.io/ ) nodes running on a user's personal device. The Service allows users to sync encrypted copies of their data privately with other devices. The service also allows users to create groups of multiple people who all use a shared encryption key to post, comment, and interact with encrypted photos and other data shared by group members (\" Sharing \" and \" Threads \"). Copies of data will be cached, on voluntary IPFS peers on the network including peers hosted by Textile, whenever a user shares data in a group Thread. Cached copies of shared data will be encrypted with keys only available to Thread members and so not readable by anyone else on the network. 2. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS \u00b6 We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time. We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Site. Any changes will be effective upon posting the revised version of these Terms (or such later effective date as may be indicated at the top of the revised Terms). If, in our sole discretion, we deem a revision to these Terms to be material, we will notify you via the Service and/or by email to the email address associated with your account. Notice of other changes may be provided via the Site. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of these Terms whenever you visit the Site to see if these Terms have been updated.

ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER \u00b6 17.1 \u00b6 Introduction. This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. 17.2 \u00b6 Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. 17.3 Arbitration Agreement \u00b6 After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California. 18. NOTICES \u00b6 We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide. We may provide required information to you by email at the address you specified when you signed up for the Service or by access to a website that we identify.

Severability; Entire Agreement These Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law.

This is the entire contract between you and us regarding the Service. It supersedes any prior contract or oral or written statements regarding your use of the Service. 19.2. \u00b6 Assignment and transfer We may assign, transfer, or otherwise dispose our rights and obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part, at any time without notice.

You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.","title":"17.1"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#172","text":"Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.","title":"17.2"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#173-arbitration-agreement","text":"After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California.","title":"17.3 Arbitration Agreement"},{"location":"policies/terms-of-service/#18-notices","text":"We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide.
