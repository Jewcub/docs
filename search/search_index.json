While data is interoperable with the whole network, Textile-flavored peers represent an additional layer or sub-network of users, applications, and services. How it works \u00b6 Textile peers use p2p messaging patterns to orchestrate shared datasets, or more specifically your chats, contacts, albums, etc. With iCloud or another major cloud provider, you expect these datasets to be synced across your iOS devices. Additionally, if you've shared a dataset like a playlist or photo album with other users, you would expect changes to be synced with their devices as well. You can expect the same with Textile, but without the centralized control of a single organization or government. A traditional cloud provider will store your datasets in one, maybe a few, central location(s). This means that you must trust the provider won't decide to drop your access, and in some cases, to not view or expose the contents of your datasets. In Textile, these types of datasets are called threads . At the core of every thread is a secret. Only peers that possess the secret are able to decrypt thread content or follow linkages. Hint Unlike a blockchain, threads are not based around the idea of consensus. Rather, they follow an agent-centric approach similar to holochain . Each peer has authority over thread access-control and storage. Because threads are simply a hash-chain of update messages, or blocks , they can represent any type of dataset. Some blocks point to off-chain data stored on IPFS. For example, a set of photos, a PDF, or even an entire website. Application developers are able add structure to threads and make them interoperable with other applications with schemas . Threads are auto-magically synced with other account peers. For example, you may have one peer on your phone, and another on your laptop, both with access to the same account seed (more about accounts here ). Threads can also be shared with other non-account peers (other users). In any case, each peer maintains a copy of its threads. A p2p messaging protocol keeps all the copies in sync. The special hash-chain or graph structure of a thread allows them to be easily shared with other peers and backed-up to cafes. Given one message, you can find all the others. Let's look a little closer at the different actors on the network. Account Peers \u00b6 User account peers share access to a single account from a data wallet . You can think of the data wallet as a collection of thread secrets. Account peers typically run on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices and expose APIs for encrypting, storing, and sharing files/data/messages, among other functions. Cafe Peers \u00b6 Cafe peers (or just cafes) are anonymous and disposable infrastructure. They provide services on behalf of users and applications without requiring trust . For example, once an account peer is registered with a cafe,\u001f all of its local (default encrypted) data is automatically synced (pinned). encrypted thread snapshots (HEAD) are automatically synced for new device sign-in and recovery. it will have an always-online message inbox for receiving thread updates from other peers when offline. its contact info will be indexed and made available for search on the network. Unlike account peers, cafes need to be online at all times in order to properly function. For this reason, they typically run in a server environment. They are easy to deploy & manage (single executable, Docker). Tip An account peer may be registered with more than one cafe, and account peers do not need to be registered to the same cafe(s). Additionally, peers can easily migrate from one cafe to another, simply be deregistering from one and registering with another. Applications \u00b6 Finally, applications run alongside or include an account peer and can create and/or access their data. Textile maintains a few reference apps like Textile Photos for desktop and mobile. Check out the client SDKs for information on how to leverage an account peer in your application. Why IPFS \u00b6 IPFS is the perfect file system for Textile for a few reasons: IPFS uses content-addressed data , meaning that content can be requested from the network as a whole by an immutable address , rather than from a single host with an arbitrary URL. This stands in the way of censorship and opens the door to Textile's decentralized, recoverable, and cross-application data storage. IPFS ships with a libp2p host, which is the best-in-class peer-to-peer networking library. Textile believes that IPFS is the distributed web of the future. Core to our mission is the idea that Textile accounts, applications, and data are interoperable with the larger IPFS network .","title":"Overview"},{"location":"learn/#how-it-works","text":"Textile peers use p2p messaging patterns to orchestrate shared datasets, or more specifically your chats, contacts, albums, etc. With iCloud or another major cloud provider, you expect these datasets to be synced across your iOS devices.

They provide services on behalf of users and applications. Access to cafe services is granted via JWT-based sessions, and initial registration with a cafe requires an access token. Any peer can operate as a cafe, though they work best for always-on peers. Cafes run an 'extra' network API that handles client and host requests over libp2p or HTTP. Tip An account peer may be registered with more than one cafe, and account peers do not need to be registered to the same cafe(s). Additionally, peers can easily migrate from one cafe to another, simply be deregistering from one and registering with another. Services \u00b6 Backup \u00b6 One of the primary functions of a cafe is to provide a recovery and new device sign-in mechanism to its clients . Once registered with a cafe, clients' data (which is, by default, encrypted) is automatically synced. This involves a combination of authenticated IPFS pinning and thread snapshots. A thread snapshot contains only the metadata and latest known update hash (HEAD) needed to reconstruct the entire thread from scratch, and is encrypted with the client's account key. This means that cafes only issue encrypted backups and are not able to read their clients' threads. This also means that the snapshots are useless if a client loses their account key. Message inbox-ing \u00b6 Very often, a peer is not online or is otherwise unreachable and therefore unable to receive a message (usually a thread update message, or block ). In this failed state, the sender can send the message to the recipient's always-online cafe(s), ensuring the message is delivered when the recipient returns online. In practice, this means that, when available, cafe \"inbox\" addresses are attached to contacts , which get published to the network. This is sort of like your phone's voicemail service, but here you're in control of where the message is actually delivered. Most importantly, because the update messages are encrypted, you do not need to trust the cafe hosting the inbox. User account indexing \u00b6 Textile provides tooling for certain types of network-wide queries, like user account search. Changes to a peer's public-facing contact is indexed and made query-able by its cafes. So, while you do not need to be registered with a cafe in order to leverage these queries, doing so may increase your chances of being discovered by others, assuming you local peer is periodically offline.

It is a JSON document located at <repo-dir>/textile . It is read once at node instantiation, either for an offline command, or when starting the daemon. Commands that execute on a running daemon do not read the config file at runtime. The various settings control different aspects of a Textile node, from public account information, to API access and functionality, to activity logging and everything in between. Here, we cover each config section in detail, though users are encouraged to explore the Textile command-line tools for further details and information (try textile config --help to get started). Account \u00b6 Stores public account information. These values are populated upon repository initialization, and are not currently configurable. * Address is the public key, whose seed is stored in the possibly encrypted datastore. * Thread is the thread id of the default account thread used for syncing information between account peers. Default : \"Account\": { \"Address\": \"\", \"Thread\": \"\" } Addresses \u00b6 Stores the bind addresses for the various node HTTP APIs. API is the address of the local node REST API (RPC). CafeAPI is the address of the cafe REST API. Gateway is the address to listen on for the IPFS HTTP gateway. The API address is the address that the daemon will serve the HTTP API from. This API is used to control the daemon through the command line (or via curl or some other client). Unlike the Gateway address, you should ensure that the API address is not dial-able from outside of your machine, or potentially malicious parties may be able to send commands to your Textile daemon. Having said that, see the [ API ] config entry for details on further controlling the API HTTP server. The CafeAPI address is the address that the Textile peer will serve the cafe REST API. This API is used to enable other peers on the network to request pinning, backup, and inbox services. Normally, a only a designated cafe peer would enable this API, though any peer may operate as a cafe if they want. See [[Cafes|Cafes]] wiki page for details. The Gateway address is the address that the daemon will serve the gateway interface from. The gateway may be used to view files through Textile, and serve static content. This port may or may not be dial-able from outside you machine, that's entirely up to you. The Gateway address is on by default, but if you leave it blank, the gateway server will not start. The Addresses config settings can be specified at node initialization via the Textile init subcommand's address options (see textile init --help for details). Alternatively, they can be modified individually via the config subcommand (e.g., textile config Addresses.API '\"127.0.0.1:40600\"' ). Default : \"Addresses\": { \"API\": \"127.0.0.1:40600\", \"CafeAPI\": \"127.0.0.1:40601\", \"Gateway\": \"127.0.0.1:5050\" } API \u00b6 Stores settings specific to the local node REST API. HTTPHeaders is a map of the HTTP headers to set on responses from the API HTTP server. The API config entry contains information (settings) to be used by the node REST API. Essentially, your daemon is running a lightweight HTTP server that will respond to client (e.g., IPFS commands, curl) requests. The HTTPHeaders sub-entry (currently the only entry under the API config option) is a map of HTTP headers to set on responses from your API HTTP server. You might want to edit these settings if you need to allow additional access control methods, or require authorization headers , etc. For example, you may want to enable CORS for your API; this can be done by modifying your \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" header. See this blog post for a discussion of similar IPFS gateway settings. These settings can be modified via the config subcommand. For example, to allow CORS from all origins, you can do textile config API.HTTPHeaders.Access-Control-Allow-Origin '[\"*\"]' . Default : \"API\": { \"HTTPHeaders\": { \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\": [ \"Content-Type\", \"Method\", \"X-Textile-Args\", \"X-Textile-Opts\", \"X-Requested-With\" ], \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\": [ \"GET\", \"POST\", \"DELETE\", \"OPTIONS\" ], \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\": [], \"Server\": [ \"textile-go/<version>\" ] } } Logs \u00b6 Stores settings relevant to logging node activities and services. LogToDisk is a boolean indicating whether to send all logs to rolling files on disk (true) or Stdout (false). The LogToDisk config entry controls how a node handles subsystem logging. By default, when LogToDisk is true , logs are written to <repo-dir>/logs/textile.log . These can be monitored via tail -f <repo-dir>/logs/textile.log or similar. The verbosity of these logs can be controlled at run-time via the Textile logs subcommand (see textile logs --help for details), or at node instantiation ( textile daemon ) via the --logs flag (see textile daemon --help for details). This config entry they can be modified directly via the config subcommand (e.g., textile config Logs.LogToDisk 'true' ). Default : \"Logs\": { \"LogToDisk\": true, } Threads \u00b6 Stores settings controlling defaults for threads. Defaults.ID is the default thread ID for reads/writes. A node can have a default thread ID that is used when a thread ID is not supplied to a given command or API call. This can simplify thread access on a peer with a singular thread, when testing command line tools, or in mobile-specific apps where a default thread is useful (for example, a user's backup thread). This setting can be accessed via the Textile threads default subcommand (or via the config subcommand), and can be set directly via the config subcommand (e.g., textile config Threads.Defaults.ID '\"<thread-id>\"' ). Default : \"Threads\": { \"Defaults\": { \"ID\": \"\" } } Cafe \u00b6 Stores settings controlling whether a node is running in cafe mode, and how it should be accessed by clients. Host is a JSON object where... Open is a boolean controlling whether other peers can register with this node for cafe services. PublicIP is a string specifying the public IP address for the Cafe. URL is a string specifying the public-facing URL of the host machine. This is needed in order to issue sessions to mobile clients, which need to communicate with the cafe over HTTP for background upload tasks. Client is a JSON object where... Mobile is a JSON object where... P2PWireLimit is an integer cutoff/limit for determining how a message will be transmitted to peers. The Cafe config entry is broken up into two sections, one for controlling how a cafe Host behaves, and one for controlling how a Client interacts with a host peer. Currently, only a Mobile client entry is used. Cafes can be controlled to some degree via the Textile cafes subcommand (see textile cafes --help for details), and via the config subcommand (see textile config --help for details). See also the [[Cafes|Cafes]] wiki page. For the Host config entries, Open is used to control if a Textile node is running in cafe mode or not. If not, then the Addresses.CafeAPI settings are not used, and the node will only operate as a potential client node. If a node is running in cafe mode , then the PublicIP config entry can be used to specify the public IP address of a cafe node in instances where IPFS' NAT traversal is unable to discover the public IP. This may, for example, happen when running a cafe on an Amazon EC2 instance or similar. Both of these settings can be modified via the config subcommand (e.g., textile config Cafe.Host.Open true ), though they will require the daemon to be restarted before taking effect. Clients normally register with one or more cafes. The Client will then remote pin/upload files/messages to a single cafe address provided by a cafe session object. Messages with size less than P2PWireLimit will be handled by the p2p cafe service, whereas messages with size greater than P2PWireLimit will be handled by the mobile OS's background upload service and the cafe's HTTP API. Clients can register with a cafe (see textile cafes register --help ), and check cafe messages (see textile cafes messages --help ) via the command line using the cafes subcommands. Again, the P2PWireLimit setting can be modified via the config subcommand (e.g., textile config Cafe.Client.Mobile.P2PWireLimit 20000 ). Default : \"Cafe\": { \"Host\": { \"Open\": false, \"PublicIP\": \"\", \"URL\": \"\" }, \"Client\": { \"Mobile\": { \"P2PWireLimit\": 20000 } } } Additional Settings \u00b6 Stores settings specific to how a local node is set up; for example, for running on a mobile device, or as a server with a public IP address. IsMobile is a boolean indicating whether the local node is setup for mobile. IsServer is a boolean indicating whether the local node is setup as a server with a public IP. These settings are only modified when initializing a new nod. For example, when accessing Textile on a mobile device, the IsMobile config entry will automatically be set to true . Conversely, when initializing a desktop or server node, the --server flag may be specified, which will set IsServer to true, and apply the IPFS server profile to the underlying IPFS node.

A wallet is represented by mnemonic phrase, and in practice is a BIP32 Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet based on Stellar's implementation of SLIP-0010 . You can learn more about BIP39 mnemonics and more in this really nice interactive webpage . You can think of a wallet as a master key, and the account (see accounts ) represent keys specific to a given application or use-case. Any given wallet may create an arbitrary number of accounts. For example, you may use a wallet to provision multiple Textile Photos 'accounts', each with a completely different persona if you so choose. This provides a powerful framework 'partitioning' use cases. It is also the backbone for enabling account backup and recovery. From the command-line, a new wallet can be generated with the textile wallet init command. The output produces a simple, multi-word 'phrase' (of varying levels of entropy) useful for the generation of deterministic binary seeds.

This simple concept is actually quite powerful \u2014 and on the surface, you can think of a Thread like a decentralized database, shared between specific participants. Threads are defined by schemas and contain blocks of information (or updates). They are specifically designed to work well in mobile, offline-first scenarios, where peers are constantly making updates, coming online, and going offline. This means avoiding state conflicts is a central focus of their operation. This issue comes up frequently when working collaboratively on documents, updating shared databases, etc. Conflict Avoidance/Resolution \u00b6 For the purposes of updating a shared Thread of photos or similar data, it turns out that an operation-based CRDT that supports append-only operations is pretty much all you need to get going. You can think of Textile's Threads CRDT (which shares some ideas with ipfs-log ) setup as an immutable, append-only tree that can be used to model a mutable, shared state between peers. Every entry in the tree is saved on IPFS, and each points to a hash of previous entry(ies) forming a graph. These trees can be 3-way and fast-forward merged . For those familiar with git and other similar system, you might be thinking this sounds a lot like a git hash tree , Merkle DAG , or even a blockchain . And you\u2019d be right! The concepts are very similar, and this buys us some really nice properties for building and maintaining a shared state. By modeling our shared Thread state in this way, we benefit from tried and tested methods for allowing a peer to incorporate other peers' updates into their state while maintaining history (via fast-forwards and three-way merging for example). Each Thread is essentially a chain of updates, where each update represents some specific action or event (see [[Blocks|Blocks]] for details). For instance, when you create a new Thread, under-the-hood you are actually creating a JOIN update on a new Thread chain. Similarly, when you update the Thread via a new photo ( FILES update), or message ( MESSAGE update), you're actually updating that Thread chain. After each modification, the HEAD of the Thread will point to the latest update. Example \u00b6 To give you a better idea of what exactly we're talking about, consider the following set of operations: User A creates a new Thread, and adds a Photo. They then externally invite User B (sent via some other secure communication channel), who eventually joins the Thread. But before User B is able to join the Thread, User A adds another Photo, moving the Thread\u2019s HEAD forward. By the time User B joins the Thread, they'd end up with a Thread sequence that looks something like this: Thread join example. Solid arrows point towards the 'parent' of a given update, over-the-wire communications are indicated with a \ud83d\udcf6-style arrow, and messages that are rebroadcast (e.g., via the welcome message) are indicated with a dashed arrow. Similarly, merges point to both their parent updates. Here, we see the merge happening at the end of the sequence because the bottom peer is joining via an external invite that is no longer HEAD , forcing them to merge the most recent DATA update with their own JOIN update. But since merge results are deterministic (given the same parents), both peers create the MERGE update locally, and do not broadcast them to avoid trading merges back and forth. A more complete sequence is given in the following figure. Suppose User A goes 'offline' (e.g., their phone goes to sleep, they shut down the app, they lose their data connection, etc), and in the mean time, both Users A and B update the Thread, with User A adding an ANNOTATION update, and User B adding a new Photo ( FILES update). Now, when User A comes back online, there is a conflict, and both Users create a MERGE update to remedy this. A MERGE update has two parents, in this case, the FILES and ANNOTATION update from the different users. As always, the HEAD continues to point to the latest update (which in the example below eventually becomes an ANNOTATION from User B). Once both peers are online again, the more straightforward update and transmit mode of operation can continue. More complex Thread interaction where one or more peers are temporarily offline. Note that an external invite is the same as a normal invite, but the invite details are encrypted with a single use key, which is sharable with the invite update location. The same properties that make hash trees or blockchains useful for developing a shared, consistent (consensus-driven) state, also makes it possible to recover the full state of a Thread from the network as a whole. Because each Thread update references its parent(s), given a single point on the Thread chain, we can trace back all the way to the beginning of the Thread. For example, at any point along the sequence in the above figures, a peer can trace back the history of the Thread, as indicated by the solid arrows. This works particularly nicely when a peer JOIN s a thread, even at a point prior to the current HEAD . They can simply JOIN , and any existing Thread member can send them the latest HEAD (even via offline messages if needed). From here, they can explore the entire history of the Thread with ease. This is all really similar to git commit speak, in which one only needs to know about a single commit to be able to trace back the entire history of a code project; it\u2019s also essentially how blockchains work. Thread Types \u00b6 Currently, Textile supports four types of Threads, 'private', 'read_only', 'public', or 'open' to support different levels of Access Control . As you might have guessed, private Threads are only accessible via the account that created them, and may be used for internal or app-based applications such as tracking different account devices, or user -specific applications such as a private camera-roll. Similarly, read_only Threads are accessible to any peer that has been invited to the Thread, but only the initiator can actually modify the Thread in any way, whereas public Threads support annotations by non-initiators . These types of Threads are useful for public, one-way consumable feeds. Conversely, an open Thread is one in which any peer that has been invited to join the Thread can modify it, invite others, etc. These are the most common type of Thread. They can support things like multi-way chat, community-curated feeds, and are currently used in Textile Photos for private groups to share photos. In addition to Thread Types for Access Control, Textile supports Thread Sharing for Sharing Control. When configuring a Thread, a Type field specifies the Thread type as specified above ('private', 'read_only', 'public', or 'open'.), and a Sharing field specifies if sharing is allowed and by whom. Options include 'not-shared', 'invite-only', and 'shared'. For 'not-shared', the Thread is pinned to a given set of \"members\", whereas 'invite-only' means only the initiator can invite additional peers. The least restrictive option ('shared') means that any existing member of the Thread may share/invite the Thread with others. Finally, an additional Members field, can be used to control which peers are able to join a given Thread. If this field is left empty, then all peers are potential members, and invites are governed entirely by the Sharing field. If this field contains one or more peers, then only those peers are permitted to interact with the given Thread. It is important to note that an invite-only Thread with a fixed members list means that invites can only be sent to the member list by the initiator, whereas an invite-only Thread with an empty member list means that invites can be sent to anyone by the initiator. This is important because all members of a Thread should expect that the member list is either fixed or not. For example, imagine a 1-1 conversation where the other peer invites a stranger in. If you had joined with the notion that the initiator could invite others (not fixed member list) then you might expect that could happen and behave slightly differently? To help illustrate the restrictions these fields provide, here is a table to give a rough idea of the available options: Access Control & Sharing Control \u00b6 Thread Type controls read (R), annotate (A), and write (W) access: private --> initiator: RAW, members: read-only --> initiator: RAW, members: R public --> initiator: RAW, members: RA open --> initiator: RAW, members: RAW Thread Sharing style controls if (Y/N) a thread can be shared: not-shared --> initiator: N, members: N invite-only --> initiator: Y, members: N shared --> initiator: Y, members: Y For example, a personal camera roll backup might be private and not-shared, whereas an open group (default in Textile Photos app) would be open and shared. Alternatively, you could support a 'closed' group by using an open, but invite-only Thread. With three 'knobs' to adjust, the combination of Thread types is quite extensive, and may facilitate new and interesting types of interactions. We do not pretend to have uses for all combinations, and some combinations may be redundant, or even contradicting in some cases (for example, an 'open', 'shared' Thread with a 'members' list of 1 is essentially just a private Thread, because membership trumps the other options). From the Command-line \u00b6 From the command-line, Threads can be added, listed, accessed, removed, and their members can be queried. See textile theads --help for details. The most basic operation, adding a new Thread, takes multiple (mostly optional) inputs, and produces a new, empty Thread. Inputs can include a key , which is a locally unique key used by an app to identify this thread on recovery, a type , which sets the thread type as discussed above, a sharing option, which controls the sharing control as discussed above, and a member option to control Thread membership. This one can be used multiple times to include multiple peers, or left blank to include any/all peers. The additional options, schema , media , and camera-roll are used to control the [[Schema|Schemas]] used for the Thread, and are discussed elsewhere. $ textile threads add --type 'open' --sharing 'shared' --media \"My Open+Shared+Media Thread\" { \"id\" : \"blahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah\" , \"key\" : \"somelongalphanumerickey\" , \"name\" : \"My Open+Shared+Media Thread\" , \"schema\" : { \"name\" : \"media\" , \"pin\" : true, \"plaintext\" : false, \"links\" : { \"large\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"pin\" : false, \"plaintext\" : false, \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"quality\" : \"80\" , \"width\" : \"800\" } } , \"small\" : { \"use\" : \":file\" , \"pin\" : false, \"plaintext\" : false, \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"quality\" : \"80\" , \"width\" : \"320\" } } , \"thumb\" : { \"use\" : \"large\" , \"pin\" : true, \"plaintext\" : false, \"mill\" : \"/image/resize\" , \"opts\" : { \"quality\" : \"80\" , \"width\" : \"100\" } } } } , \"schema_id\" : \"Qmblahblablablahbnlajbnlajlk\" , \"initiator\" : \"P4blahblahblahblahbla\" , \"type\" : \"OPEN\" , \"sharing\" : \"SHARED\" , \"state\" : \"LOADED\" , \"peer_cnt\" : 1 , \"block_cnt\" : 1 , \"file_cnt\" : 0 }","title":"Overview"},{"location":"learn/threads/#conflict-avoidanceresolution","text":"For the purposes of updating a shared Thread of photos or similar data, it turns out that an operation-based CRDT that supports append-only operations is pretty much all you need to get going.

By the time User B joins the Thread, they'd end up with a Thread sequence that looks something like this: Thread join example. Solid arrows point towards the 'parent' of a given update, over-the-wire communications are indicated with a \ud83d\udcf6-style arrow, and messages that are rebroadcast (e.g., via the welcome message) are indicated with a dashed arrow. Similarly, merges point to both their parent updates. Here, we see the merge happening at the end of the sequence because the bottom peer is joining via an external invite that is no longer HEAD , forcing them to merge the most recent DATA update with their own JOIN update. But since merge results are deterministic (given the same parents), both peers create the MERGE update locally, and do not broadcast them to avoid trading merges back and forth. A more complete sequence is given in the following figure. Suppose User A goes 'offline' (e.g., their phone goes to sleep, they shut down the app, they lose their data connection, etc), and in the mean time, both Users A and B update the Thread, with User A adding an ANNOTATION update, and User B adding a new Photo ( FILES update). Now, when User A comes back online, there is a conflict, and both Users create a MERGE update to remedy this. A MERGE update has two parents, in this case, the FILES and ANNOTATION update from the different users. As always, the HEAD continues to point to the latest update (which in the example below eventually becomes an ANNOTATION from User B). Once both peers are online again, the more straightforward update and transmit mode of operation can continue. More complex Thread interaction where one or more peers are temporarily offline. Note that an external invite is the same as a normal invite, but the invite details are encrypted with a single use key, which is sharable with the invite update location. The same properties that make hash trees or blockchains useful for developing a shared, consistent (consensus-driven) state, also makes it possible to recover the full state of a Thread from the network as a whole. Because each Thread update references its parent(s), given a single point on the Thread chain, we can trace back all the way to the beginning of the Thread. For example, at any point along the sequence in the above figures, a peer can trace back the history of the Thread, as indicated by the solid arrows. This works particularly nicely when a peer JOIN s a thread, even at a point prior to the current HEAD . They can simply JOIN , and any existing Thread member can send them the latest HEAD (even via offline messages if needed). From here, they can explore the entire history of the Thread with ease. This is all really similar to git commit speak, in which one only needs to know about a single commit to be able to trace back the entire history of a code project; it\u2019s also essentially how blockchains work.","title":"Example"},{"location":"learn/threads/#thread-types","text":"Currently, Textile supports four types of Threads, 'private', 'read_only', 'public', or 'open' to support different levels of Access Control . As you might have guessed, private Threads are only accessible via the account that created them, and may be used for internal or app-based applications such as tracking different account devices, or user -specific applications such as a private camera-roll. Similarly, read_only Threads are accessible to any peer that has been invited to the Thread, but only the initiator can actually modify the Thread in any way, whereas public Threads support annotations by non-initiators . These types of Threads are useful for public, one-way consumable feeds. Conversely, an open Thread is one in which any peer that has been invited to join the Thread can modify it, invite others, etc. These are the most common type of Thread. They can support things like multi-way chat, community-curated feeds, and are currently used in Textile Photos for private groups to share photos. In addition to Thread Types for Access Control, Textile supports Thread Sharing for Sharing Control. When configuring a Thread, a Type field specifies the Thread type as specified above ('private', 'read_only', 'public', or 'open'.), and a Sharing field specifies if sharing is allowed and by whom. Options include 'not-shared', 'invite-only', and 'shared'. For 'not-shared', the Thread is pinned to a given set of \"members\", whereas 'invite-only' means only the initiator can invite additional peers. The least restrictive option ('shared') means that any existing member of the Thread may share/invite the Thread with others. Finally, an additional Members field, can be used to control which peers are able to join a given Thread. If this field is left empty, then all peers are potential members, and invites are governed entirely by the Sharing field. If this field contains one or more peers, then only those peers are permitted to interact with the given Thread. It is important to note that an invite-only Thread with a fixed members list means that invites can only be sent to the member list by the initiator, whereas an invite-only Thread with an empty member list means that invites can be sent to anyone by the initiator. This is important because all members of a Thread should expect that the member list is either fixed or not. For example, imagine a 1-1 conversation where the other peer invites a stranger in. If you had joined with the notion that the initiator could invite others (not fixed member list) then you might expect that could happen and behave slightly differently? To help illustrate the restrictions these fields provide, here is a table to give a rough idea of the available options:","title":"Thread Types"},{"location":"learn/threads/#access-control-sharing-control","text":"Thread Type controls read (R), annotate (A), and write (W) access: private --> initiator: RAW, members: read-only --> initiator: RAW, members: R public --> initiator: RAW, members: RA open --> initiator: RAW, members: RAW Thread Sharing style controls if (Y/N) a thread can be shared: not-shared --> initiator: N, members: N invite-only --> initiator: Y, members: N shared --> initiator: Y, members: Y For example, a personal camera roll backup might be private and not-shared, whereas an open group (default in Textile Photos app) would be open and shared. Alternatively, you could support a 'closed' group by using an open, but invite-only Thread. With three 'knobs' to adjust, the combination of Thread types is quite extensive, and may facilitate new and interesting types of interactions. We do not pretend to have uses for all combinations, and some combinations may be redundant, or even contradicting in some cases (for example, an 'open', 'shared' Thread with a 'members' list of 1 is essentially just a private Thread, because membership trumps the other options).","title":"Access Control &amp; Sharing Control"},{"location":"learn/threads/#from-the-command-line","text":"From the command-line, Threads can be added, listed, accessed, removed, and their members can be queried.

Additionally, input data can be transformed (or milled in Textile speak) and validated in order to provide programmable structure to your thread data. Currently, the following input types are available: Raw data blobs, images, exif data, and JSON documents. Thread data is built into an IPLD merkle DAG structure (similar to a merkle tree ) and stored separately from the block on IPFS. A Files block points to it's \"data DAG\"'s top-level hash. The structure of the data DAG is determined by, and validated against, a DAG schema . A thread can have only one schema . It has two main functions: Define a Thread's data DAG structure Define the order of mills (transforms) needed to produce this structure from the input To illustrate these functions, take a look at the builtin media schema. Each link ( large , small , thumb ) produces a resized and encrypted image by leveraging the image/resize mill. Notice that the thumb link uses the large as input. This means that large will need to milled before thumb . Once you understand how schemas and mills work, you can design complex workflows and structures for your applications. In addition to the transformed bytes, a mill will produce a file index object for every input: message FileIndex { string mill = 1; // Mill used to process the file (e.g., `/image/resize`, `/json`) string checksum = 2; // Pre-milled (md5) checksum of the input file string source = 3; // Source file CID string opts = 4; // md5 checksum of input mill options string hash = 5; // CID hash of milled file string key = 6; // AES encryption key string media = 7; // Media type (e.g., `'application/json'`, `'image/jpeg'`) string name = 8; // Name of the input file int64 size = 9; // Size of the milled file in bytes google.protobuf.Timestamp added = 10; // Date the file was added to the thread google.protobuf.Struct meta = 11; // Additional metadata repeated string targets = 12; // DAG targets the file belongs to (kept only by the local peer) } File indexes are what most applications will interact with. They are the objects listed by the Files and Feed APIs. These objects are also used internally for various functions. For example, because good encryption is not deterministic, an input's checksum is used to de-duplicate encrypted data. At this point, it should be clear that adding data to a thread results in a DAG defined by a schema. But how exactly is the data stored so as to be programmatically accessible to thread consumers? Let's take a closer look at the DAG produced by the builtin media schema... Note that a files target is by default a directory of indexes ( 0 , 1 , etc.). This mean that you can add an entire folder of images (or whatever your data is) with a single update. Also, each link ( large , small , etc.) will always have the special f and d sub-links, which correspond to the (usually encrypted) file index and raw data. Below is a JSON representation of file indexes from a single image corresponding to say, file 0 above. { \"links\": { \"large\": { \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"checksum\": \"EqkWwbMQoSosYnu85XHpdTsM3NDKTRPk5j4RQjN6c4FZ\", \"source\": \"D4QdxGCAFnGwCHAQxrros1V6zEf78N4ugK3GwZyT5dTJ\", \"opts\": \"21uBAuSeQUdw5aDu5CYPxEfeiLVeuvku1T26nWtJC84C\", \"hash\": \"QmcvoHe333KRf3tfNKrtrM7aMUVnrB4b1JyzhSFybepvqQ\", \"key\": \"6cCnusZVHwp6udnKv3eYhurHK6ArJyFxCYRWTUFG8ZuMwSDwVbis9FUX3GRs\", \"media\": \"image/jpeg\", \"name\": \"clyde.jpg\", \"size\": \"84222\", \"added\": \"2019-03-17T01:20:17.061749Z\", \"meta\": { \"height\": 600, \"width\": 800 }, \"targets\": [ \"QmPngweFQ9VUhjtyy8nfJRZ8us9UFbS6Y2trwmAswfJ2yk\" ] }, \"small\": { \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"checksum\": \"7Gu5s6sZkwU8UQWwJNnJSrVY75ZkQG4bpQSwQPwkk8aX\", \"source\": \"D4QdxGCAFnGwCHAQxrros1V6zEf78N4ugK3GwZyT5dTJ\", \"opts\": \"CassDcqf192MnceweJKGJvhZfrV9kB3GJRbvNPWm6raa\", \"hash\": \"QmZuD522rQiFE2GdbNXvzcQ3Ci6aLvvJtWz52a97iEDy9G\", \"key\": \"29ce4pg64Lj78GuTauQDxeqpfdNCF7fNsJauS552wfpkEjegq8kQgwiNAzJQZ\", \"media\": \"image/jpeg\", \"name\": \"clyde.jpg\", \"size\": \"18145\", \"added\": \"2019-03-17T01:20:14.739531Z\", \"meta\": { \"height\": 240, \"width\": 320 }, \"targets\": [ \"QmPngweFQ9VUhjtyy8nfJRZ8us9UFbS6Y2trwmAswfJ2yk\" ] }, \"thumb\": { \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"checksum\": \"GzB1CWKkKQ5sWS8qQXDoBZxsfFgsgZwD9Z51qX5d7LGW\", \"source\": \"EqkWwbMQoSosYnu85XHpdTsM3NDKTRPk5j4RQjN6c4FZ\", \"opts\": \"7aGVJ7nGgmHdqv8oiEKZ2ZbrNBv1zVP3ADSuT2sW3MwT\", \"hash\": \"QmUuXPhrtLJUzfuoJu7BkfiB2mGfKwq4ExTTF8gVUvAh2U\", \"key\": \"KfW8nTEZqh1NbAcmB51DMaooe34ujucx2DMqBwiz4xs9sDVhNDYNPratgtbf\", \"media\": \"image/jpeg\", \"name\": \"clyde.jpg\", \"size\": \"2979\", \"added\": \"2019-03-17T01:20:17.133863Z\", \"meta\": { \"height\": 75, \"width\": 100 }, \"targets\": [ \"QmPngweFQ9VUhjtyy8nfJRZ8us9UFbS6Y2trwmAswfJ2yk\" ] } } }","title":"Overview"},{"location":"learn/threads/files/mills/","text":"In order to fulfill a Textile Schema, input data will likely have to be processed by a Mill . A Textile Mill is simply an interface that provides a unique endpoint id, whether it supports encryption (most do/should), whether it will 'pin' its outputs by default, and the type of 'media' that it supports. For things like image processing mills (resize, extract EXIF) this would be \"image/*\" mime-types, whereas for a generic 'blob' type Mill, this might be nil (accepts anything). Additionally, a Mill will have a specific set of options that it supports, and of course, implement the actual function that performs the 'milling' or processing. This should take in 'raw' bytes, and return a Result object, which is simply a wrapper around a file byte array and its metadata (see below). Depending on how the Schema is structured, Mills may be combined, run in series (i.e., one run on the output of a another) or parallel, etc. It is generally up to the client to satisfy the Schema via the requested Mills. For developers, adding new Mills is relatively straightforward, and only requires that they satisfy the specified Iinterface. This makes Schemas and Mills extremely powerful and flexible.

Schemas are used to define how data is processed and its storage structure. You can think of Textile Schemas as something akin to Transloadit Robots . Essentially, Textile uses these well-defined Schemas to describe what the Textile Peer should do with incoming Files. For example, the [[default Schema|Default-Schemas]] used in Textile Photos defines how images should be transformed and shared over IPFS. When developing with Textile, developers can define or reuse any number of custom schemas. Schemas describe how a File or image is processed as a series of 'steps'. Using the default Textile [[camera roll schema|Default-Schemas#camera-roll]] as an example, it tells the Textile Peer to resample and encrypt an image to thumb nail size, extract and encrypt the exif data into a JSON document using the raw input image, encrypt the raw image data (blob), and then store ( pin : true ) all of these output files on IPFS in a single 'folder' or DAG structure. It is possible to specify highly complex file/object structures in this way, with dependencies between Schema Nodes (a Node describes a DAG node) and Links (a Link is a sub-node which can \"use\" input from other sub-nodes). The Textile Peer will automatically sort this 'graph' of dependencies (using topological sorting ) and process the Mill steps in the correct order. Each Node or Link contains keys controlling whether its output (or child outputs) should be pinned, encrypted, and how it should be milled (Mill function and Options). message Node { string name = 1; bool pin = 2; bool plaintext = 3; string mill = 4; map<string, string> opts = 5; google.protobuf.Struct json_schema = 6; map<string, Link> links = 8; } message Link { string use = 1; bool pin = 2; bool plaintext = 3; string mill = 4; map<string, string> opts = 5; google.protobuf.Struct json_schema = 6; } Presets \u00b6 Textile includes several schema \"presets\". These are used in the Textile Photos app, but also provide useful examples of real-world schema use. These are listed below, along with some examples of JSON-type schemas for reference/demo purposes. Media \u00b6 Used for media posting and sharing { \"name\": \"media\", \"pin\": true, \"links\": { \"large\": { \"use\": \":file\", \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"opts\": { \"width\": \"800\", \"quality\": \"80\" } }, \"small\": { \"use\": \":file\", \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"opts\": { \"width\": \"320\", \"quality\": \"80\" } }, \"thumb\": { \"use\": \"large\", \"pin\": true, \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"opts\": { \"width\": \"100\", \"quality\": \"80\" } } } } Camera Roll \u00b6 Used for backing up a user's mobile phone camera roll { \"name\": \"camera_roll\", \"pin\": true, \"links\": { \"raw\": { \"use\": \":file\", \"mill\": \"/blob\" }, \"exif\": { \"use\": \"raw\", \"mill\": \"/image/exif\" }, \"thumb\": { \"use\": \"raw\", \"pin\": true, \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"opts\": { \"width\": \"320\", \"quality\": \"80\" } } } } Avatars \u00b6 Used for creating and storing a user's avatar image { \"name\": \"avatar\", \"pin\": true, \"links\": { \"large\": { \"use\": \":file\", \"pin\": true, \"plaintext\": true, \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"opts\": { \"width\": \"320\", \"quality\": \"75\" } }, \"small\": { \"use\": \":file\", \"pin\": true, \"plaintext\": true, \"mill\": \"/image/resize\", \"opts\": { \"width\": \"100\", \"quality\": \"75\" } } } } JSON-based \u00b6 It is also possible to create a new Schema that supports JSON data. This is pretty simple to setup, requiring only that we use the pre-existing /json Mill, and a few other minor keys for controlling pinning, encryption (we'll keep things in plaintext for now), and the json_schema definition. As always, Schemas start with a few basic keys: { \"pin\": true, \"plaintext\": true, \"mill\": \"/json\", \"json_schema\": ... } Unlike in the above examples however, notice the (currently empty) json_schema entry. This is where/how we define the actual expected JSON structure for our Schema. It is based on the JSON Schema vocabulary for annotating and validating JSON documents. So, our Textile Schema will actually contain the JSON schema that we can use to validate the input JSON data before processing it via Mill(s). This is really nice, because it ensures that Textile's Thread data stays structured, making it easier for application developers to trust that the data added to a Thread conforms to their expected data model. Examples \u00b6 For example, a very simple 'person' Schema would look something like this: { \"pin\": true, \"mill\": \"/json\", \"json_schema\": { \"$id\": \"https://example.com/person.schema.json\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\", \"title\": \"Person\", \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"firstName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The person's first name.\" }, \"lastName\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"The person's last name.\" }, \"age\": { \"description\": \"Age in years which must be equal to or greater than zero.\", \"type\": \"integer\", \"minimum\": 0 } } } } A slightly more advanced example might be for adding basic log data as specified in the BSD syslog Protocol to a Thead, the whole Textile Schema would look something like this: { \"pin\": true, \"plaintext\": false, \"mill\": \"/json\", \"json_schema\": { \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Log\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\", \"definitions\": { \"Log\": { \"additionalProperties\": false, \"properties\": { \"application\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"hostname\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"message\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, \"pid\": { \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"priority\": { \"type\": \"integer\" }, \"timestamp\": { \"type\": \"string\" } }, \"required\": [ \"priority\", \"timestamp\", \"hostname\", \"application\", \"pid\", \"message\" ], \"type\": \"object\" } } } } Alternatively, if a developer wanted to send document updates via a Thread, they'd need a JSON Schema that supports modifying JSON documents. The JSON Patch specification, as outline in RFC 6902 , is one such specification: \"JSON Patch defines a JSON document structure for expressing a sequence of operations to apply to a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) document...\" You can obtain a JSON Schema representation of the JSON Patch spec from the JSON schema 'store' . Combining the JSON Patch schema.org spec with a Textile Schema spec gives: { \"pin\": true, \"plaintext\": true, \"mill\": \"/json\", \"json_schema\": { \"title\": \"JSON schema for JSONPatch files\", \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": { \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/operation\" }, \"definitions\": { \"operation\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"required\": [ \"op\", \"path\" ], \"allOf\": [ { \"$ref\": \"#/definitions/path\" } ], \"oneOf\": [ { \"required\": [ \"value\" ], \"properties\": { \"op\": { \"description\": \"The operation to

We cannot decrypt or otherwise access the data you privately store or share with your contacts. You can choose to share your data such as photos in public forums whereby anyone can view the data contents. Textile provides remote data storage for users on the IPFS network (see https://ipfs.io/ ). The IPFS protocol has no mechanisms for deletion of data once added, so instead, we allow users to 'revoke' their data, such that all servers in the IPFS network run through Textile (including those in the mobile app) will discontinue the hosting and displaying of said data. When you share photos in group forums (\"Threads\"), the encryption keys for the data (full resolution photo, lower resolution copies, and basic metadata) are shared with Thread members and are visible to anyone with the keys to that Thread. Keys are distributed whenever you, or another Thread member, invite new members to the Thread. The encrypted data shared in Threads are distributed over a network of voluntary IPFS servers that no single member, or the Textile organization, controls.

ABOUT THE SERVICE \u00b6 The Service offers verification and authentication services and encryption services for users of photos and other personally collected data. The Service provides a private data storage system (\" Storage \") for users to maintain remote copies of their privately encrypted data. Storage is managed on IPFS ( https://www.ipfs.io/ ) nodes running on a user's personal device. The Service allows users to sync encrypted copies of their data privately with other devices. The service also allows users to create groups of multiple people who all use a shared encryption key to post, comment, and interact with encrypted photos and other data shared by group members (\" Sharing \" and \" Threads \"). Copies of data will be cached, on voluntary IPFS peers on the network including peers hosted by Textile, whenever a user shares data in a group Thread. Cached copies of shared data will be encrypted with keys only available to Thread members and so not readable by anyone else on the network. 2. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS \u00b6 We reserve the right to revise these Terms from time to time. We will date and post the most current version of these Terms on the Site.

ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER \u00b6 17.1 \u00b6 Introduction. This Section 17 includes an arbitration agreement and an agreement that all claims will be brought only in an individual capacity (and not as a class action or other representative proceeding). Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below. 17.2 \u00b6 Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action. 17.3 Arbitration Agreement \u00b6 After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California. 18. NOTICES \u00b6 We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide. We may provide required information to you by email at the address you specified when you signed up for the Service or by access to a website that we identify.

Severability; Entire Agreement These Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by relevant law.

It is not for the benefit of any other person, except for permitted successors. 19.4. \u00b6 Claims You must bring any claim related to these Terms or the Service within one year of the date you could first bring the claim, unless your local law requires a longer time to file claims. If it isn\u2019t filed in time, the claim is permanently barred. 19.5. \u00b6 Waiver The failure of you or Textile to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any rights or remedies under these Terms will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of your right or Textile\u2019s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will remain in full force and effect. 19.6. \u00b6 Government Use If you are a U.S. government entity, you acknowledge that any Software and User Guides that are provided are \u201cCommercial Items\u201d as defined at 48 C.F.R. 2.101, and are being provided as commercial computer software subject to the restricted rights described in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212. 20.

Please read it carefully. You may opt out of the arbitration agreement by following the opt out procedure described below.","title":"17.1"},{"location":"policies/tos/#172","text":"Informal Process First You agree that in the event of any dispute between you and Textile, you will first contact Textile and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the dispute before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation any court action.","title":"17.2"},{"location":"policies/tos/#173-arbitration-agreement","text":"After the informal dispute resolution process any remaining dispute, controversy, or claim (collectively, \u201cClaim\u201d) relating in any way to your use of Textile\u2019s services and/or products, including the Service, or relating in any way to the communications between you and Textile or any other user of the Service, will be finally resolved by binding arbitration. This mandatory arbitration agreement applies equally to you and Textile. However, this arbitration agreement does not (a) govern any Claim by Textile for infringement of its intellectual property or access to the Service that is unauthorized or exceeds authorization granted in these Terms or (b) bar you from making use of applicable small claims court procedures in appropriate cases. If you are an individual you may opt out of this arbitration agreement within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use this Service by following the procedure described below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration. Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Textile are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms. If you wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to Textile, Inc., Attn: President, 85 Broad St., 18 th Floor - NY, NY 10004. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules including, if you are an individual, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the Services on behalf of an entity, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language and California law will apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. If you are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the \u201cClass Action Waiver\u201d section below. If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Textile and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to [ legal@textile.io ] within thirty (30) days of the first date you access or use the Service. CLASS ACTION WAIVER Any Claim must be brought in the respective party\u2019s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiff, or similar proceeding (\u201cClass Action\u201d). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Textile each waive any right to a jury trial and each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in San Francisco, California.","title":"17.3 Arbitration Agreement"},{"location":"policies/tos/#18-notices","text":"We may send you, in electronic form, information about the Service, additional information, and information the law requires us to provide.

Initialize a cafe peer \u00b6 Anyone can run a cafe peer and offer services to the network. You do not need to rely on Textile's cafe network, or anyone else's network for that matter. Cafe peers are initialized by adding some additional flags to textile init . --cafe-open \u00b6 This flag \"opens\" the cafe, meaning that it will expose an additional \"service\" API over libp2p and HTTP. --cafe-url \u00b6 The full public URL of the cafe service HTTP API. By default, this is http://<SWARM_PUBLIC_IP>:40601 . However, if you've placed your peer behind a DNS-based load balancer and/or require HTTPS, you may specify the full URL. For example, Textile's federated cafes run behind EC2 load balancers with HTTPS listeners, which route traffic to the cafe API port. This is 40601 by default and configurable with the --cafe-bind-addr option. Info Cafe service clients are issued JWT sessions used for authentication. These sessions contain the public URL of the cafe peer's service API so that it can be leveraged over HTTP. Later, when the peer is started, it's service info will be visible at the cafe URL, e.g., https://us-west-1c.textile.cafe . { \"peer\": \"12D3KooWQue2dSRqnZTVvikoxorZQ5Qyyug3hV65rYnWYpYsNMRE\", \"address\": \"P6th8SM6V3uSVQWgQz8AkFos3rwYzky2K7Bt6vx4h1jZGZne\", \"api\": \"v0\", \"protocol\": \"/textile/cafe/1.0.0\", \"node\": \"0.1.11\", \"url\": \"https://us-west-1c.textile.cafe\", \"swarm\": [ \"/ip4/13.57.23.210/tcp/4001\", \"/ip6/2600:1f1c:522:b00:2725:b0b3:f39d:c401/tcp/4001\" ] } You can modify the init settings anytime but editing the config file and restarting the peer. Read more about the cafe host config settings here . Run the daemon \u00b6 Now that you have initialized as either an account peer or a cafe peer, you can finally start the daemon: textile daemon See textile daemon --help for more.
