## Contributing

**Contribute to the [Textile WIKI](https://github.com/textileio/textile-go/wiki)** with any additions or questions you have about Textile and its various impmenentations. A good example would be asking, "What is a thread?". If you don't know a term, odds are someone else doesn't either. Eventually, we should have a good understanding of where we need to improve communications and teaching together to make Textile even better.
  
Before you get started, be sure to read our [contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [contributor covenant code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
