[Textile](https://www.textile.io) provides encrypted, recoverable, schema-based, and cross-application data storage built on [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs) and [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p). We like to think of it as a decentralized data wallet with built-in protocols for sharing and recovery, or more simply, **an open and programmable iCloud**.

# Developer

## Why use Textile

Textile was built for developers who believe in a better future for our technology. Textile tools standardize use of decentralized protocols, secure communications, and user data sovereignty.

- Build decentralized applications that run in mobile applications, on the web, or on desktop.
- Give users greater control over their data by making it easily available for their own storage or use in future applications.
- Leverage IPFS on any device.
- Access simple APIs for encryption throughout an application.

## What can you build with Textile

Build apps and service that treat users and their data the same.

- Build decentralized storage and sharing applications. See [Textile Photos](https://github.com/textileio/textile-mobile).
- Build better ways for users to manage their private information. See [AirSecure](https://github.com/airsecure/airsecure).
- Build chat apps, website publishing services, health apps, family tools, and more. Got an idea, [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io/).
